0,"During the evening rush hour, a group of students protesting a recent fare increase forces their way past the closed gates of a Singapore MRT station, disregarding the station manager's attempts to bar entry. Simultaneously, across town, another group of protesters chains themselves to the doors of an MRT train, preventing the doors from closing and the train from departing on schedule.","The scenario showcases a violation of the regulation by two groups: the first group is refusing to comply with the authority's right to refuse admission by forcing entry into the railway premises, while the second group is undermining the authority's ability to control the opening and closing of exits and entrances, in this case, the train doors, which could lead to operational disruptions and potential safety risks.","{'1': ""In Singapore's MRT, during a televised charity event, participants create a blockade by laying flowers on the tracks at City Hall station, preventing trains from leaving the platform.""}",
1,"At the MRT station in Singapore, an individual, reeking of alcohol and swaying unsteadily, bumps into several passengers, leaving dirty shoe marks on their clothes while attempting to board the train. Meanwhile, another passenger covered in wet paint ignores the stares and proceeds to sit down, smearing the fresh paint over the seats.","The presence of a passenger under the influence of alcohol violates the regulation against entering the railway premises while intoxicated or in an improper condition, particularly as it results in physical contact that soils other passengers' clothing, posing a safety risk. Additionally, the passenger with wet paint on their clothing clearly contravenes the rule against wearing garments that may soil property, as evidenced by the paint being transferred onto the seats.","During the bustling Thaipusam festival celebrations in Singapore, a participant with traces of ceremonial paint on his arms boards an MRT train, subtly leaving hand prints on the handrails and seats.","[""This scenario describes a violation where an individual's condition causes potential soiling of the railway premises, due to the presence of paint on their skin, which can stain handrails and seats. Even in the context of a cultural celebration, this breaches the specified regulation against entering or remaining on railway premises in a condition that can damage property or affect other passengers.""]"
2,"During the evening rush hour at a busy MRT station in Singapore, a group of teenagers is seen ducking under the ticket gates to avoid payment and enter the platform area. Simultaneously, a passenger, ignoring the exit signs, climbs over a barrier adjacent to the ticket gates to leave the station.","The group of teenagers violates the regulation by not using the ticket gates provided for entry as they duck under them, which is the improper use of entry means. The passenger climbing over a barrier to exit is also not using the proper means provided for exit as per the regulation, i.e., the ticket gates or other directed means by an authorized person.","At a bustling Singaporean festival adjacent to an MRT station, where street performers captivate the crowd, a couple slips through an emergency exit door left ajar to avoid long queues, directly accessing the platform. Nearby, a distracted staff member fails to notice another individual jumping over the fare gate amongst the throng of event-goers.","[""This scenario showcases two clear violations of [regulation]: the couple's use of an unauthorised access point (emergency exit door) to enter the platform area, and the other individual's improper crossing over the fare gate. Both acts disregard the proper usage of ticket gates and other authorized means for entering and exiting the premises, as required by the regulation.""]"
3,"During peak hour in Singapore's MRT, a commuter enters a crowded train with an unfolded mountain bike, blocking the aisle and brushing the muddy wheels against seated passengers' clothes. On another train, a tourist carelessly rides a scooter, which has an electric motor running, through the station concourse, narrowly missing other commuters.","The first commuter violates the regulation by bringing an unfolded bicycle onto the train, which should be folded and kept with its longest side in a vertical position. They further fail to comply by allowing the wheels to soil passengers' clothing. The tourist on the scooter infringes the regulation by not switching off the electric motor while on the railway premises.","In the midst of the evening rush within Singapore's MRT, a well-dressed individual maneuvers delicately between the commuters with a sleek foldable e-scooter, its lights on, apparently in transit mode. Another commuter is seen carefully placing a compact, but unfolded, foldable bike into an overhead bin, while passengers nearby remain oblivious to the infraction.","The first commuter’s e-scooter violates the regulation by being switched on inside the MRT, posing a safety risk. The second commuter's foldable bike, though compact, is unfolded and stowed improperly, violating the conditions requiring it to be folded with its longest side in a vertical position while in the railway premises."
4,"On a busy weekday morning at the Jurong East MRT station in Singapore, an individual is seen gliding through the crowd on an electric scooter while waiting for the next train. Nearby, another commuter stands beside their unfolded bicycle, chatting with friends in a non-boarding area.","The scenario depicts two violations: first, the use of a personal mobility device (electric scooter) within the railway premises is prohibited. Second, the presence of an unfolded bicycle in the paid area, without the intent of using the railway, contravenes the stated regulation.","At the Queenstown MRT station in Singapore during off-peak hours, a commuter is observed carefully balancing a folded electric scooter on their lap while seated on a bench, intermittently using their foot to propel themselves forward slightly. Another individual stands quietly with an unfolded bicycle beside the fare gates, seemingly checking their phone while occasionally shifting the bike's position.","Despite both activities appearing less disruptive, they violate [regulation] as the use of a foot to glide the scooter within MRT premises, however slight, goes against clause (b), and having an unfolded bicycle beside the fare gates can be construed as preparing to enter the paid area, which contravenes clause (a) if the individual is not using the railway."
5,"At the busy Dhoby Ghaut MRT station in Singapore, a commuter maneuvers through the crowd with his electric scooter's motor running, the handlebar and pedals sticking out dangerously, drawing frustrated glances from onlookers. As he passes by, the wheels, covered in mud from an earlier journey, leave a grimy trail on the pristine station floor.","The scenario shows multiple violations of the regulation: firstly, the commuter's electric scooter has its motor switched on while maneuvering through the station, secondly, the extended handlebar and pedals present a safety hazard, and thirdly, the dirty wheels deposit grime onto the railway premises, all against the stipulated railway regulations.","In the less congested Ang Mo Kio MRT station, a commuter stands quietly to the side, his electric scooter neatly folded by his feet, yet the faint hum of the device suggests that the motor is surreptitiously left running.","This scenario violates part (4)(a)(iv) of [regulation] as it describes a commuter who has not switched off the electric motor of his personal mobility device while on railway premises, despite the scooter being folded as required."
6,"In the midst of the morning rush, a commuter nonchalantly strides through a Singapore MRT station with a leashed ferret perched on his shoulder, drawing curious glances as he boards a crowded train car. Meanwhile, a passenger with a pet carrier discreetly unlatches it, allowing her cat to roam freely, curling up on a seat next to an unsuspecting tourist.","The scenario violates the regulation as it involves two individuals bringing animals, a ferret, and a cat, onto railway premises where animals are not permitted unless they are guide dogs for the visually or hearing impaired, dogs under the control of a police or auxiliary officer, or a security officer on duty. Both actions clearly contravene the prohibition in paragraph (1) as neither animal fits the exemption categories.","[""During a lull in afternoon traffic, a distinguished-looking gentleman strolls into Dhoby Ghaut MRT station accompanied by a sleek Doberman Pinscher donning a plain harness, and with a confident nod to bystanders, they board a train headed towards HarbourFront. Passengers glance approvingly at the pair, assuming the presence of an unmarked service dog, even as the dog casually lies down by its owner's feet next to the priority seat.""]","The scenario illustrates a violation of the [regulation] as it features a Doberman – a breed not customarily used as a guide animal – without clear identification as a service dog and with no uniformed officer or person with a visible impairment in sight. It subtly plays on the potential for passengers to misinterpret the dog as a service animal, thus initially overlooking the violation."
7,"A group of youths, disdainful of the rules, smuggle firecrackers onto a Singaporean MRT train as part of a dare, intending to light them while en route to a New Year's celebration. In another instance, a man absentmindedly enters the North East Line with a lighter and a can of petrol he had just bought for his broken-down motorbike, intending to transport them home.",These scenarios both depict violations of the regulation which prohibits unauthorized individuals from bringing dangerous or flammable substances onto railway premises. The youths with firecrackers and the man with petrol and a lighter pose serious safety risks and breach the conditions set by the Authority.,"A magician, performing a series of street shows in Singapore, absentmindedly brings a small tank of propane used for his fire-breathing act onto an MRT train, unaware that it is against the rules.","The scenario violates the regulation because the magician is carrying flammable propane, a danger on railway premises, despite being distracted by his performance preparations."
8,"During the evening rush, a performer unlicensed by the Authority begins a fire-breathing show on the crowded platform of Singapore's Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, drawing a circle of onlookers and obstructing the flow of passengers. Simultaneously, a group of youths skateboard through the throng, dodging between commuters and performing stunts.","This scenario includes two violations of the regulation: the performer conducts a fire-breathing show without authorization, posing a safety hazard and obstructing passenger movement on the platform. The group of youths skateboarding disrupts the orderly flow of foot traffic and may cause collisions or injuries, ignoring the reasonable directions for behavior on railway premises.","Amidst the backdrop of a popular cultural festival at Singapore's Clarke Quay MRT station, a flash mob seemingly part of the festivities breaks into synchronized dance, inadvertently causing a blockade and forcing commuters to detour dangerously close to the tracks. Meanwhile, street vendors exploiting the distraction set up unauthorised food carts along the platform, further impeding safe passage.","The scenario violates the regulation by having individuals and vendors ignoring directions likely given to maintain safety and passenger flow—commuters are endangered by having to walk perilously close to the tracks, and the food carts create additional obstacles that are not compliant with the reasonable instructions of authorized persons."
9,"During the evening rush hour at the Jurong East MRT station in Singapore, a frazzled commuter hastily discards his half-eaten sandwich onto the platform as he juggles multiple bags, while another absentmindedly sticks her used chewing gum underneath a bench.","In this scenario, the commuter blatantly violates the [regulation] by throwing litter (the sandwich) rather than disposing of it in a bin, and the second commuter places chewing gum somewhere other than a trash receptacle, both acts clearly prohibited in the railway premises.","Amidst a lively street performance drawing a crowd at Raffles Place in Singapore, a distracted tourist casually drops a crumpled brochure on the pavement as they take photos; nearby, a local, engrossed in watching the show, flicks a cigarette butt to the side.","This scene highlights two instances of violating the regulation: the tourist is littering by dropping a brochure, and the local is improperly disposing of a cigarette butt, both of which are not placed into designated receptacles."
10,"During the evening rush hour, a passenger aboard the MRT in Singapore begins to loudly play music on his portable speaker, completely disregarding the discomfort of the crowded compartment filled with returning office workers.","Playing loud music in a confined space like a train carriage directly causes a nuisance to other passengers, showing a blatant disregard for the regulation that requires maintaining a quiet and comfortable environment for all commuters.","[""In the midst of peak hour bustle on the Singaporean SMRT, a businessman's phone rings with a blaring tune that pierces through the clamor of the packed train, yet amidst the commotion, no one seems to intervene.""]","The loud ringtone causing a piercing noise in a crowded MRT train equates to a breach of the regulation as it contributes to the nuisance and annoyance of other passengers, which may be exacerbated by the high-stress environment of rush hour."
11,"During rush hour at a Singapore MRT station, a frustrated commuter angrily throws their malfunctioning umbrella onto the tracks just as a train is approaching. In the same moment, a teenager, aiming to impress friends, hurls a soda can from an overpass onto a platform crowded with passengers.","The scenario describes two separate and deliberate actions that violate the regulation: first, the commuter's throwing of an umbrella onto the train tracks endangers incoming trains and could cause damage or injuries. Second, the teenager's act of dropping a soda can from above onto a crowded platform could injure passengers below and create a safety hazard.","[""At the bustling Tampines MRT station in Singapore, a street magician in the midst of an act 'accidentally' lets a metallic coin roll out of his hand, which promptly slips through the platform gap and onto the tracks. Laughter ensues from the onlookers, distracted by the performance and not considering the repercussions of the coin’s journey.""]","The scenario depicts a regulation violation where an individual indirectly causes an item to be deposited onto railway premises. This action, although seemingly accidental and part of entertainment, still carries the potentiality to damage property, such as the train, or endanger individuals by possibly causing a train to derail or creating sparks that lead to fire hazards."
12,"During the peak evening hours at the Singapore Downtown Line, an individual is spotted bypassing the ticket barriers and scurrying into the maintenance tunnel adjacent to the train platform.","This scenario depicts a clear violation of the regulation as the individual has entered an unauthorised area of the train system, specifically a maintenance tunnel that is not intended for passenger use, without proper authorisation.","{'1': ""In the bustling Singapore MRT station, a teenager, wearing a high-visibility vest, is seen confidently stepping over the boarding area boundary line and swiftly ducking under a train carriage, obscured by the crowd's focus on a street performer nearby.""}","{'1': ""Despite the distraction of the street performer, the teenager's actions are in direct violation of the regulation, as they involve unauthorized entry into a non-passenger area of the train, which is strictly prohibited and poses a direct safety hazard.""}"
13,"In a bustling MRT station in Singapore, a teenager, daring his friends to a challenge, brazenly climbs onto the coupling between two train cars, attempting to surf as the train pulls away. In another instance, a commuter irked by a malfunctioning ticket gate kicks it forcefully, causing further damage to the mechanism.","{'explanation': ""In the first situation, the teenager's act of climbing onto the coupling of the train cars directly interferes with the railway vehicle and poses a grave danger to himself and others, violating the clause that prohibits meddling with any vehicle used upon the railway. In the second, the commuter’s aggressive act of kicking the ticket gate meddles with and damages the electrical equipment, being an infringement of the part that bans any improper meddling or damaging of railway property.""}","During rush hour at a Singapore MRT station, a commuter casually leans against a closed train door, repeatedly pressing the emergency release button while engrossed in a phone conversation.","This scenario demonstrates a violation of the regulation as the commuter is meddling with the train's emergency mechanism without a valid reason, which is considered improper use of the mechanical equipment controlled by the railway, and could compromise the safety of railway operations."
14,"During a crowded evening rush hour at a central MRT station in Singapore, a teenager, wishing to impress friends, nonchalantly sits and slides down the handrail of an operational escalator, amidst gasps from onlooking commuters.","This act is a clear violation of the given regulation as it involves riding on the handrail of an escalator within railway premises, which is expressly prohibited, posing a safety risk to both the teenager and other commuters.","In the midst of a festive street performance outside a busy Singapore MRT station, a daring street artist climbs onto and rides down the handrail of an adjacent escalator to the cheers of the captivated audience.","The scenario depicts a violation of the regulation that prohibits sitting or riding on any handrail of an escalator within railway premises. The street artist's actions, although part of a performance, disregard the safety regulations and could lead to injury or disruption within the railway premises."
15,"During rush hour at a busy MRT station in Singapore, a teenager, in a bid to impress friends, hops onto the upward-moving escalator heading downwards, laughing as commuters dodge him.","The teenager's actions violate [regulation] by traveling in the opposite direction to the escalator’s movement, causing potential harm to himself and commuters, and creating unnecessary disruption during a peak transit period.","In the hustle of Singapore's peak train hours, a commuter absorbed in his phone mistakenly strides onto a downward-moving escalator while trying to go up, causing momentary confusion among fellow passengers.","Despite seeming accidental, the commuter's actions violate the regulation as he attempted to travel in the opposite direction to the escalator's movement, which poses a safety risk to himself and others."
16,"During a busy weekend at a local shopping mall, a teenager, mischievously motivated by a social media dare, reaches up and pulls the fire alarm lever, causing a cacophony of sirens and flashing lights, and instantly creating a panic among the unaware shoppers.","The teenager in this scenario violates the regulation by activating a fire alarm, which is a safety device, without authorization and for a purpose other than its intended use (responding to a fire emergency). The act goes against explicit instructions and was performed in a recreational endeavor, not out of necessity.","{'1': ""In the heart of Singapore's bustling Orchard Road, a tourist, intrigued by the design of a fire alarm at a metro station, presses the button 'just to see what happens', oblivious to the chaos that ensues.""}",
17,"During rush hour at a busy MRT station in Singapore, a commuter frustrated with the delays purposefully jams his umbrella into the side of a platform screen door to prevent it from closing, causing further train service disruptions.","This scenario depicts a violation of the regulation as the commuter intentionally interferes with the operation of a platform screen door using an object, which is not permitted in any instance other than an emergency or by an authorised person fulfilling their duties. This creates a safety hazard as well as service disruptions for the public transportation system.","[""At a bustling MRT station in Singapore, a passenger pretends to trip and 'accidentally' spills coffee on the sensors of a platform screen door, briefly preventing the door from closing and resulting in a short delay for the train's departure.""]","This action violates the regulation because it constitutes interference with the operation of platform screen doors. Although it was done under the guise of an accident, it caused a disruption and did not occur under the circumstances permitted by the regulation (emergency situation or by an authorized person performing their duties)."
18,"During the morning rush in a Singapore MRT station, an overstressed office worker, hurrying to catch the train, carelessly leaves his bulky briefcase on the platform, blocking the way of other commuters. Elsewhere, a street performer, attempting to earn some money in the underpass, inadvertently gathers a crowd that hinders the flow of passengers transitioning between trains.","Both instances breach the regulation by creating obstructions on railway premises: the misplaced briefcase creates a physical barrier for commuters, and the performer's crowd becomes an impediment to the flow of pedestrian traffic. The office worker and the street performer fail to ensure that their belongings and activities do not interfere with the safety and convenience of others using the railway.","In the evening commute at a bustling MRT station in Singapore, a distracted parent, absorbed in her phone conversation, unknowingly allows her excited toddler to wander off with a balloon, which gets caught in an escalator, causing passengers to dodge and bottleneck dangerously around the area.","The scenario illustrates a violation of the given regulation whereby the parent's lack of attention resulted in their child, with the balloon, obstructing the passageway and creating a safety hazard. It shows how the chaos from a seemingly innocuous situation can escalate into a significant danger, reflecting non-compliance with the regulation against causing obstructions on railway premises."
19,"In a busy Singapore MRT station, a commuter reports that he has lost his ticket but refuses to pay the administrative charge, becoming confrontational and arguing that he should not have to pay additional fees as it wasn't his fault the ticket got lost.","This scenario violates the [regulation] because the commuter has reported the loss of his ticket but fails to comply with the stipulated requirement to pay the administrative charge before leaving the paid area. Instead, the individual argues and becomes confrontational, thereby violating the regulation which mandates the payment upon the loss of a ticket.","At a bustling Singapore MRT station, a visibly distressed mother, separated from her child in the crowd, rushes to the exit to chase after the kid, shouting that she lost her ticket amidst the chaos but can't stop to pay because her child's safety is at risk.","The scenario illustrates a violation because, despite the emergency of a lost child, the mother is still required by the regulation to report and pay an administrative charge for her lost ticket before leaving the paid area; her failure to do so constitutes a non-compliance with the regulation."
20,"Upon arriving at a concert in Singapore, Alex, aware of the policies for event tickets, flashes a screenshot of an online ticket sale webpage to the usher instead of presenting an official ticket and insists on being granted entry claiming the digital image as proof of purchase.","Alex's behavior violates the regulation by attempting to use an unaccepted form of ticket verification, as opposed to an official ticket, to gain entry. Despite knowing the official conditions of use, he deliberately tries to circumvent these by presenting a digital image not recognized as a valid ticket.","In a Singaporean theater, Jamie poses with a celebratory banner and quickly flashes a printed email confirmation to the usher, slipping into the venue amid the distraction caused by a famous actor's arrival.","The scenario implies a violation of [regulation] as Jamie does not present an official ticket but an email confirmation, which might not be recognized as valid proof of purchase. Moreover, the usher is visually distracted, and Jamie exploits the situation to gain entry without proper verification, potentially compromising venue security and event policies."
21,"At the crowded Downtown Interchange, a savvy commuter negotiates with the train conductor to pay $5 less than the fare listed on the official notice for his journey, citing his frequent travel. The conductor, eager to please a regular, accepts the deal and pockets the money, bypassing the mandated ticketing system.",The scenario shows a violation of the regulation as the commuter and the conductor agree on a fare that is not consistent with the authorised fares publicly listed by the Authority or its licensee. Both parties are complicit in a transaction that undermines the established fare system.,"{'1': ""In Singapore, a train operator at the Tampines MRT station, capitalizing on the busy morning rush, offers an 'express boarding' service for an extra S$2, allowing passengers to skip the queue and board the train immediately, without purchasing a ticket from the official machines.""}","{'1': ""The scenario violates the regulation as the 'express boarding' service constitutes an unauthorized fare not posted at the station by the Authority or its licensee. Additionally, by not requiring a ticket purchase through the official system, it bypasses the regulated process and compromises the integrity of the fare control.""}"
22,"During the peak evening rush, a passenger boards the North-East Line at Harbourfront Station, Singapore, with a ticket valid only for travel within the city's southern zones but proceeds to stay on the train until the northernmost terminus, Punggol, well outside his ticket’s designated travel area.","This scenario illustrates a violation of the stated regulation as the passenger travels on the railway system beyond the conditions of use stipulated by his zone-restricted ticket. The regulation is breached because the individual does not leave the train within the zones for which the ticket is valid, thereby disobeying the railway’s travel restrictions.","On a busy weekday, a traveler in Singapore, who is new to the city, is engrossed in a conversation with another passenger about the complexities of the MRT ticketing zones; distractedly, he exits the train at Ang Mo Kio, not realizing his tourist pass only allows travel up to Orchard.","This scenario illustrates a violation of the regulation due to the passenger's use of a transport pass to travel to an area not covered by it. Despite the distraction of being new to the city and engaged in conversation, the passenger's action of disembarking beyond the permitted zone constitutes a breach of [regulation]."
23,"After finishing her shopping at a mall in Singapore, Gina lingered in the MRT station's paid area, chatting on her phone with a friend and losing track of time well beyond the hour allocated for passenger transition.","Gina's behavior violates the regulation as she did not leave the paid area within the prescribed period and had no reasonable excuse for staying in the paid area beyond the time limit, which could result in her having to pay an administrative charge.","While helping an elderly man who seemed disoriented at a Singapore MRT station, Sarah exceeded the station's paid area time limit by 30 minutes, unaware of the passing time.","Despite Sarah's good intentions in assisting the elderly man, her actions violated the regulation which requires passengers to leave the paid area within a specified period, as she remained there beyond the permissible duration without a reasonable excuse."
24,"In Singapore, a passenger plans to sue the train service provider after missing an important job interview due to a train arriving late, despite holding an express ticket that advertises priority boarding and punctual service.","This scenario is in violation of the [regulation] since the passenger is seeking to hold the train service provider accountable for arriving late at a station and indirectly causing the passenger to miss a job interview, even though the regulation clearly states that the Authority and its licensee do not guarantee arrival times or the completion of ticket transactions before train departure.",,
25,"In Singapore, a family has decided to sue the metro Authority for emotional distress after they were not allowed to disembark from a delayed train that missed its connection, causing them to miss a once-in-a-lifetime family reunion.","This scenario violates the [regulation] by showing an attempt to hold the Authority or its licensee liable for losses or damages incurred due to the suspension, discontinuation, or alteration of train services, which is an action the Authority or its licensee can take at its discretion without being liable according to the given regulation.","In Singapore, a train abruptly departs from Dhoby Ghaut station without prior notice, moments before the scheduled arrival of a connecting service, leaving several passengers stranded and bewildered on the platform.","The scenario violates [regulation] as the authority's action of dispatching a train before the arrival of a connecting service, without affording passengers the chance to board, inconveniences patrons and potentially endangers those who might rush to catch the train. Although the authority can alter schedules, doing so without warning undermines passenger safety and service reliability."
26,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, John, frustrated with the long queue at the fare gates during peak hours, deliberately scratches off the date on his single-journey ticket with a coin so that it cannot be determined whether his ride has expired.","John's actions violate regulation 1(a) as he has erased the coded data on his ticket, making it unclear whether his ticket is still valid, and thereby he has also damaged the ticket in contravention of regulation 1(b).","[""In the hustle of Singapore's morning commute, Alice accidentally spills her coffee on her own EZ-link card while trying to balance her bag and a takeaway cup, partially obscuring the card's data section."", 'She hurriedly wipes it off, but the sticky residue makes the card unresponsive when she taps it at the exit gantry of her destination.']","[""Alice's spilt coffee on the EZ-link card caused damage to and potential alteration of the coded data, which is a clear violation of [regulation] (1), specifically parts (a) and (b)."", 'Despite the act being accidental, it still resulted in the card being unable to function properly, reflecting interference with the ticketing system.']"
27,"Jason, after meticulously altering the date on his month-old MRT pass to make it appear valid, confidently strides through the gantries at Marina Bay Station in Singapore.","Jason's actions violate the [regulation] because he has used a ticket that has been improperly altered with the intention of travelling on the railway without a valid fare, which is illegal and compromises the integrity of the transit fare system.",,
28,"A commuter in Singapore refuses to show their ticket when asked by an MRT officer, claiming that the ticket is their personal property and they are not obligated to produce it upon request.",This scenario violates the [regulation] because it states that all tickets shall remain the property of the Authority and must be produced at any time within the railway premises on demand by any authorised person. The commuter's refusal directly contravenes this requirement.,"[""In the bustle of Singapore's MRT during peak hours, a commuter is overheard boasting to fellow passengers about sneaking a pet terrapin on board, all while subtly avoiding an inspector who's asking to see their MRT pass.""]","The scenario violates the regulation as the commuter is failing to produce the MRT pass upon request by an authorized person, which is required as per the defined regulation. Furthermore, the attention is diverted by the mention of the terrapin, which is likely against MRT rules as well, serving as a secondary violation and potential distraction from the ticketing issue."
29,"During a hectic Friday evening at a popular Singaporean mall, a shopper in a hurry decides to park their motorcycle directly beside the railway tracks for quick access to the mall entrance, disregarding the no-parking signs displayed around the premises.","This scenario violates the [regulation] as the individual left a vehicle (motorcycle) unattended on the railway premises which is under the control of the Authority or its licensee, without obtaining any written permission. The presence of the motorcycle could potentially hinder railway operations and pose a safety risk.","At a bustling hawker center next to the Bugis MRT station in Singapore, a street food vendor temporarily parks their delivery bike against a service gate leading right to the train platform, so they can load up on supplies unnoticed amidst the lunchtime crowd.","This reaction violates the regulation by leaving a vehicle on railway premises without permission, creating a potential safety risk and accessing an area meant to be free of such obstructions."
30,"In Singapore, the Authority towed away Melissa's car for parking illegally in a no-waiting zone but neglected to notify her of the car's detention or the location where it was held; two weeks later, Melissa found out about her car's fate through a third-party towing company.","This scenario violates [regulation] because it depicts the Authority failing to serve notice to the vehicle's registered owner about the detention, which should have been carried out 'as soon as practicable' as mandated by the regulation. Additionally, the Authority's reliance on a third-party towing company to inform the owner is not in accordance with established procedural requirements.","['In Singapore, during an unprecedented flash flood, the Authority was forced to tow numerous vehicles, including Jenna’s scooter, from a rapidly submerging underpass to higher ground.', ""Amidst the emergency evacuation efforts, Jenna was only informed about her scooter's relocation three days later when she inquired at the local police station.""]","[""This scenario violates regulation 44 because, despite the challenging circumstances of a flash flood, the Authority still failed to notify the owner, Jenna, as 'soon as practicable' about the detention of the vehicle."", 'While the emergency situation may provide a context in which the delay could seem more understandable, it does not absolve the Authority from the responsibility of timely notification as mandated by the regulation.']"

32,"During rush hour at a busy Singapore railway station, a commuter in a hurry drives a motor scooter down the platform alongside departing trains, weaving through the crowd to bypass the congestion.",The commuter's action of driving a motor scooter through a crowded railway platform presents a clear danger to the pedestrians and violates the regulation by failing to adhere to the designated purpose of the platform and by driving in a manner that endangers others.,"At a quiet Singapore MRT station, a film crew captures a scene for a local movie where an actor rides a vintage bicycle along the empty platform, as part of a heartwarming flashback sequence. Passengers watching the filming smile at the nostalgic sight, unware that this act contravenes railway safety regulations.","The scene violates the regulation as it involves driving a vehicle (the vintage bicycle) through railway premises, something that is forbidden regardless of the purpose or the lack of immediate apparent danger to others. The charm of the filmed scene and the context of a movie shoot may cause the audience to overlook the safety risks and the violation of the regulation."
33,"On a sweltering afternoon at the Bugis MRT station in Singapore, a hurried commuter spots a designer watch lying unattended on a platform bench but, instead of turning it in, discreetly slips the watch into his pocket and continues on his journey.","This scenario violates the regulation because the commuter, upon finding lost property at the railway premises, chooses to keep the item for himself instead of handing it over to an authorised person at the station which is mandated by the regulation.","In the midst of a bustling crowd at the Chinatown MRT station in Singapore, a young tourist excitedly taking numerous selfies accidentally drops a sleek drone into a decorative planter. Ignoring the lost drone, the tourist is swept away by friends, leaving the device concealed among the ferns.","In this scenario, the regulation is violated because the lost drone, which is now unattended property within the railway premises, should have been reported and handed over to an authorized person at the station. Instead, it was disregarded and concealed, potentially posing a safety risk if the device is equipped with batteries that could be flammable."
34,"In the bustling City Hall MRT Station in Singapore, a commuter finds an expensive-looking watch on a bench and, impressed by its design, slips it into his pocket with the intention of keeping it. Elsewhere at the Orchard Station, a teenager discovers a digital camera left on a seat, and decides to take it home, ignoring the lost and found bin located near the station's exit.","Both individuals in the scenarios are violating the regulation by removing property from the railway premises without the authorization to do so and without the purpose of handing it over to an authorised person. The actions of taking the watch and camera for personal use, despite being aware that they are not the owners, demonstrate the misconduct as outlined by the regulation.","During a heavy downpour at Tanah Merah MRT Station in Singapore, a soaked and shivering elderly man picks up a high-end umbrella left unattended on a bench, using it to shield himself from the relentless rain as he exits the station. At the same time, a young woman at Raffles Place MRT Station finds an iPhone on the platform and, after hesitating and looking around to find its owner, pockets the phone and quickly walks away.","Both individuals in the scenarios have committed a violation of the regulation by not turning the found items over to an authorised person. The elderly man uses the umbrella for personal relief from the weather, while the young woman, despite a moment of apparent consideration, ultimately decides to keep the iPhone for herself."
35,"In Singapore, an individual discovers a wallet containing cash and credit cards at the metro station and instead of turning it over to the Authority, sells the found items online after two weeks of possession, ignoring the Authority's guidelines.","This scenario violates [regulation] because the individual did not adhere to the guidelines that deem the Authority or its licensees responsible for handling lost property. Specifically, the individual failed to allow the Authority to retain the all non-perishable, non-noxious, or non-offensive goods for a period of 3 months, choosing instead to sell the items before the allowed disposal period.","In Singapore, a local finds an expensive watch on a public bus and, considering it a stroke of good fortune, donates it to a charity auction two weeks later, believing the cause justifies bypassing the metro authority’s guidelines.","This action violates the regulation which requires that all non-perishable items found should be turned over to the Authority and retained for a period of 3 months. Donating the watch to a charity auction, regardless of the intention, does not follow the legal procedure for found items."
36,"In Singapore, after recovering her stolen bicycle that was sold at an auction by the Authority, Jane provided proof of ownership but was denied the proceeds by the Authority, which demanded an excessive indemnity far beyond what could be considered reasonable.","This scenario violates [regulation] as Jane, having proven her ownership within the stipulated six-month period, was denied the proceeds from the auction sale of her bicycle. The Authority's demand for an excessively high indemnity contradicts the regulation's provision for 'providing the Authority or its licensee with an indemnity in such form as the Authority or its licensee may reasonably require'.","In Singapore, the Authority sold a collection of unclaimed imported electronics at a public auction and, when the original owner provided documentation asserting ownership, the Authority offered to pay the proceeds only after presenting an indemnity covering potential claims from erratic electrical outbursts the goods caused, which is higher than usual practice.","The scenario violates the regulation as it implies that the Authority is conditioning the repayment of the sale proceeds to the original owner with an indemnity that goes beyond reasonable demands. This indemnity is designed to cover potential claims that are unlikely and far-fetched (erratic electrical outbursts), thus failing to satisfy the regulation that the form of indemnity should be reasonable."
37,"After a packed day at the Singapore Food Festival, a visitor claims that their expensive backpack, which they allege contained valuable personal items, was stolen while dining at a food stall licensed under the Authority. The visitor is now demanding compensation from the Authority, claiming negligence led to the theft of their property.",This scenario violates the [regulation] because the visitor is attempting to hold the Authority responsible for their lost property and is seeking compensation for the same. The regulation explicitly states that the Authority and its licensee are not liable for lost property and cannot be compelled to pay damages or compensation for it.,"During a guided heritage walk organized by the Authority in Singapore, a tourist’s camera is misplaced at one of the historical sites. Despite the Authority's role in overseeing the event, all personal belongings left unattended are subject to the non-liability clause of the regulation.","Though the Authority organized the event and had oversight, the regulation explicitly states that they are not liable for any lost property, even in circumstances where they have some control or involvement with the venue or event."
38,"During the bustling lunch hour, a hurried food delivery rider parks his tricycle beside a ticketing machine inside a busy MRT station in Singapore, dashing off to deliver a meal and intending to return shortly for it.","This action violates the regulation by parking a tricycle in an area of the railway premises not designated for such vehicles, potentially causing obstruction and safety risks, and makes it liable to removal by the Authority or its licensee after a written notice.","In the midst of a heavy downpour, a visibly distressed father quickly parks his trishaw beside the sheltered walkway of Tanjong Pagar MRT station in Singapore while rushing his sick child to the nearest clinic.","The trishaw is parked in an undesignated area of the railway premises, which violates the regulation stating that vehicles such as trishaws must not be parked outside of designated parking zones. Despite the urgent circumstance, the action still presents a safety hazard and potential obstruction."
39,"In the bustling streets of Singapore, Jason hurriedly parks his tricycle used for food deliveries by the sidewalk, not realizing that the notice indicating the vehicle's license number had fallen off earlier in the day.","This scenario depicts a violation of the regulation because the notice, which should be affixed to a conspicuous part of the tricycle, is absent, thus failing to comply with the mandatory requirement stated in the regulation.","On a humid afternoon at the iconic Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, Li Hua parks her tricycle at the designated area, the license notice is discreetly taped under the seat, barely visible to passersby.","{'Explanation': ""While the license notice is affixed to the tricycle, its placement under the seat does not comply with the requirement of [regulation] for the notice to be on a conspicuous part, thereby violating the visibility obligation and creating potential confusion for identifying the tricycle's license number.""}"
40,"During the morning rush at the Tanah Merah MRT station in Singapore, a rusted tricycle laden with plastic bags filled with cans is found obstructing one of the busy exit gates, causing commuters to squeeze through the remaining space. Above the tricycle, a faded note reads 'Back in 5', but the owner is nowhere in sight.","This scenario violates the [regulation] because the tricycle is causing obstruction and inconvenience to the commuters trying to exit the railway station. The tricycle, left unattended with a note suggesting a brief absence of the owner, directly contravenes the immediate removal clause prescribed by the law for such obstructions.",,
41,"In Singapore, an irate man forcibly retrieves his impounded bicycle from a secured municipal storage facility without settling the impoundment fees or receiving authorization from an officer.","This scenario violates the [regulation] because the owner of the bicycle bypassed the process of paying required expenses and obtaining release under the direction of an authorized person, which are conditions stipulated for the release of detained vehicles.",None,None
42,"In the heart of Singapore’s downtown shopping district, a young man boldly unscrews a notice attached to an impounded bicycle outside a bustling mall, flinging it into a nearby bin. Moments later, he attempts to cut the lock and remove the bicycle from its detained spot as onlookers pass by.","The scenario describes a person unscrewing and disposing of a notice affixed to a detained bicycle, which is a direct violation of part (a) of the [regulation]. Additionally, by attempting to cut the lock, the person is trying to remove the impounded bicycle from its detained place, thereby violating part (b) of the [regulation]. Both actions are unauthorized and represent clear breaches of the specified regulation.","Near the iconic Merlion Park in Singapore, a well-dressed individual casually examines a notice on a detained bicycle, ostensibly checking the contents before subtly sliding it into his briefcase. He then glances around and swiftly snips the lock with bolt cutters concealed within his jacket.",This scenario demonstrates a violation of the regulation as the individual removes a notice affixed to a bicycle without authorization and then proceeds to illegally remove the bicycle from its detained state using bolt cutters.
43,"In Singapore, a commuter comes to the Authority's office, angry and demanding the return of his trishaw, which was removed from the prohibited parking area 2 months ago; however, he was unaware of the notice posted at the time. The Authority informs him that the trishaw had already been disposed of the previous week.","This scenario illustrates a violation against the [regulation] because the trishaw owner attempts to reclaim his property well beyond the one-month period after the official notice, during which time the Authority is within their right to dispose of the unclaimed vehicle.","In Singapore, a trishaw owner misses the notice for his impounded vehicle's collection due to extensive traveling, only to discover upon his return two months later that his trishaw was sold by the Authority at a public auction the previous week.","This scenario illustrates a violation of the regulation as the Authority disposed of the trishaw without ensuring that the owner had a reasonable chance to claim it, possibly neglecting the requirement to serve a notice with due diligence."
44,"At a bustling Singapore MRT station, a disgruntled commuter loudly proclaims intent to vandalize a transit map on the platform wall, taking out a marker as they approach the public information board. Nearby, a suspicious individual is caught on CCTV tampering with the emergency stop button on a busy train, causing immediate alarm among passengers.","The scenario illustrates two separate violations: one individual displayed intentions and actions that lead to the suspicion of vandalism—defacing the transit map, which is a property of the railway. Another individual is seen interfering with critical train safety equipment, which falls under the violation of attempting to commit a breach of regulations as it threatens the safety and operation of the railway service.","On a quiet afternoon in a Singapore MRT station, an individual casually attaches a homemade decorative cover over a CCTV camera, claiming it's an art project to make the station 'look better'. Another commuter, believing it's part of an official event, assists by holding a ladder.","The scenario depicts a violation of the regulation as the individual's actions obstruct the view of the CCTV, which is vital for security, and can be reasonably suspected as tampering. Although the actions are disguised as an art project, they still constitute a breach that an MRT employee with knowledge of the regulation would have grounds to remove the individuals from the premises."
45,"In the midst of nationwide train system upgrades in Singapore, a passenger, infuriated by the repeated delays and cancellations, takes legal action against the train service provider for mental distress and loss of income due to the persistent disruptions.","This scenario violates the [regulation] as it demonstrates a passenger attempting to hold the train service provider liable for personal losses attributed to service alterations and challenges, despite the regulation stipulating that the provider and its agents are exempt from such liability upon the passenger's acceptance of a ticket.","During a public demonstration in Singapore against the recent fare increases, a disgruntled commuter loudly blames the train operator's staff for her personal losses due to train delays, unaware that her admission ticket carries a legally-binding agreement limiting liability. An onlooker, versed in the regulations, notices the misplaced blame but chooses to record the rant for social media instead of correcting the misunderstanding.","The regulation stipulates that those accepting tickets agree to limitations and exemptions from liability afforded to the train service provider and their agents. The passenger's public accusation directly violates this regulation, as she is attempting to hold the staff personally responsible despite the liability limits that she agreed to upon accepting the ticket."
