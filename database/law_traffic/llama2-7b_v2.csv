0,"During a busy morning rush, a street performer forcefully enters the closed off exit of Orchard MRT station in Singapore, setting up a juggling act that blocks the alternate exit, causing confusion among passengers trying to leave.","This scenario violates the regulation by depicting a person who ignores the Authorityâ€™s or its licensee's right to close exits from the railway premises, therefore breaching their management of entrance and exit points, contributing to congestion and potential safety risks.","On a weekend afternoon at Bugis MRT station, a group of volunteers, wearing vests similar to the MRT staff's uniforms, starts handing out free reusable water bottles at a temporarily closed entrance, drawing a crowd and inadvertently preventing access to a designated open entrance nearby.","This act violates the [regulation], particularly the part about the Authority's right to manage access to railway premises. Despite the good intentions, the volunteers do not have the authorization to use the closed entrance for their activity, nor to cause obstruction to an open entrance. Their actions result in an unauthorized interference with the premises' accessibility and could mislead passengers into thinking the activity is officially sanctioned."
1,"In a busy MRT station in Singapore, a man staggers through the crowd, spilling his open can of beer onto the floor and passengers, causing discomfort and a slippery hazard in his wake.","The scenario depicts a violation of [regulation] as the intoxicated state of the man entering and remaining on the railway premises is expressly prohibited by the regulation. Furthermore, his spilled beer soiling the dress and clothing of passengers, as well as creating a potential slipping hazard, breaches the rule about being in a condition likely to cause injury or damage.",,
2,"In the heart of Singapore, a graffiti artist boldly paints murals on the restricted service access doors inside a busy MRT station, while commuters regularly exit through emergency doors bypassing the ticket barriers during peak hours.",The graffiti artist is violating the regulation by entering restricted areas not designated for public use and altering them with unauthorized artwork. Commuters exiting through emergency doors are also in violation as they leave railway premises through means other than the proper use of ticket gates or as directed by authorized personnel.,,
3,"On a busy weekday afternoon at a Singapore MRT station, a defiant teenager wheels his unfoldable electric scooter through the bustling concourse area, its handlebars jutting out and snagging on the clothing of passing commuters. In his haste, he neglects to switch off the scooter's motor, causing it to suddenly accelerate and knock over a businesswoman's suitcase.","This scenario depicts violations of the regulation: firstly, the teen's electric scooter isn't folded as required and its handlebars are causing obstruction and risk of injury, contravening parts (a) and (d). Secondly, the motor should be switched off within railway premises, but it remains running and results in property damage, violating part (e) of the regulation.","In Singapore's busy MRT during rush hour, a commuter carefully steps in with a foldable bicycle in a partly folded state, ensuring the handlebars don't protrude, yet leaves the wheels uncovered while silently gliding through the crowd.","Although the commuter appears to be considerate by preventing the handlebars from protruding, they violate paragraph (2)(c) of [regulation] by not covering the wheels of the foldable bicycle to prevent dirt transfer and (2)(a) by not having the bicycle completely folded."
4,"During rush hour at a Singapore MRT station, an individual unfolds his electric scooter in the paid area and starts using it to navigate through the crowd to reach the platform faster, causing other commuters to dodge away to avoid collision.","{'explanation': ""The individual's action of using his personal mobility device within the paid area for purposes other than traveling using the railway goes against the regulations. The scenario violates point (a) because they are not in the paid area for the sole purpose of using the railway, and point (b) as they are operating the device within the railway premises, which is expressly forbidden.""}","[""At a bustling MRT station in Singapore, right before evening peak hours, a commuter unfolds his electric scooter adorned with a delivery bag bearing a popular food delivery service logo, causing nearby passengers to believe it's allowed there.""]","The scenario illustrates a violation of the specific regulation stated in paragraph (3)(a) and (b), which prohibits remaining in the paid area with a non-folded personal mobility device unless in transit for railway use and explicitly forbids riding or using these devices within the railway premises. The presence of a delivery service logo induces a false sense of authorization and potentially misleads onlookers."
5,"In a busy MRT station in Singapore, a commuter wheels in an unfolded electric scooter, its motor still running, causing a visible trail of dirt from the wheels across the polished floor. Ignoring the requests of an MRT staff member, the commuter refuses to fold the scooter or switch off the motor, dodging through the crowd and narrowly missing an elderly passenger.","{'explanation': ""The commuter's actions violate multiple aspects of [regulation]: (i) failing to fold the electric scooter and maintain it with its longest side in a vertical position; (ii) not covering the wheels to prevent dirt transfer onto the railway premises; (iii) not switching off the electric scooter despite it being propelled by an electric motor; and (iv) disregarding the authorized person's instruction to fold the scooter and turn off the motor, which could potentially cause inconvenience, obstruction, or injury to other passengers.""}","In the quieter section of a Singapore MRT station, a distracted commuter with headphones enters dragging an unfolded, motorized kick scooter with the power still on, maneuvering around the maintenance crew absorbed in setting up for National Day decorations.","The commuter is violating [regulation] by not folding the scooter, not switching off its motor, and potentially causing inconvenience or danger in public space. This scenario presents the violation during a potentially distracting situation due to the National Day preparations, making it easier to overlook."
6,"During the busy morning commute at Dhoby Ghaut MRT station in Singapore, a man enters the platform with a large parrot perched on his shoulder, flustering nearby passengers and causing a commotion as the bird squawks loudly and flaps its wings.","The man's action of bringing a parrot, which is not an exception outlined in the regulation, into the MRT station violates the prohibition stated in paragraph (1) of the regulation. Furthermore, the parrot's disruptive behavior could potentially cause injury or damage within the railway premises, for which the man would be responsible as per paragraph (2).",,
7,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, a local artist illegally carries a container of highly flammable paint thinner onto the train, intending to create a mural at his destination. The fumes from his container start to spread through the carriage, causing passengers to cough and opening the possibility of a fire hazard.","The scenario depicts a violation of the regulation because the artist, who is neither an employee of the Authority nor a licensee, brought a flammable substance onto the railway premises. This situation could compromise passenger safety due to the risk of fire or poisoning from inhalation.","In a bustling Singapore MRT station, a passenger inconspicuously carries a disguised, but overloaded, power bank that is actually a hazardous lithium battery swelling with potential to ignite. Fellow commuters, absorbed in their mobile devices, are oblivious to the risk that breaches the strict safety regulations of the railway.","The passenger violates [regulation] by bringing a dangerous and potentially flammable lithium battery into the railway premises without authorization, creating a safety hazard for all present, indicative of the risk of fire or explosion due to the condition of the battery."
8,"During rush hour at a train station in Singapore, an individual is observed using a portable speaker to loudly play promotional messages for a real estate agency, while another person hands out homemade flyers for a private tutoring service, both without any visible authorization.","The individual using the speaker to play promotional messages is in violation of the regulation because they are using the railway premises for advertising without obtaining the necessary permissions as outlined by the regulation. Additionally, the other person is also in violation by distributing flyers, which is a form of advertising, without written permission.","At a lively MRT station in Singapore, amidst the sounds of trains and chatter, a duo of street performers plays traditional music, with a small digital screen discreetly embedded in their instrument case, cycling through various real estate advertisements. An astute observer might notice leaflets subtly tucked in with instruments, available for commuters who stop to listen, advertising a local tutoring center without explicit permission.","The presence of the digital screen with real estate ads and leaflets for the tutoring center indicate promotional activities that likely have not been approved by the railway authorities. This violation is not immediately evident due to the focus on the music performance, but it is discernible to those aware of the regulations regarding the need for authorization for promotional activities on railway premises."
9,"At the bustling Jurong East MRT station in Singapore, a man is observed carelessly tossing a used tissue onto the tracks as he chats on his phone, while another passenger nonchalantly sticks a piece of chewed gum underneath a bench.","Throwing a tissue onto the railway tracks and sticking gum underneath a bench are both clear violations of the regulation, which prohibits placing or throwing litter, or disposing of chewing gum in any area of the railway premises except in designated receptacles.",,
10,"During a busy evening commute on the MRT in Singapore, a passenger begins loudly practicing a trumpet inside the crowded train car, disrupting the peace and concentrating solely on his scales and arpeggios oblivious to the annoyance of other passengers.",This action violates the regulation as practicing a trumpet in a confined and public space like a train car is likely to cause a nuisance or annoyance to other passengers due to the loud and repetitive nature of the practice.,,
11,"On a bustling morning at the Tanah Merah MRT station in Singapore, a disgruntled commuter throws his malfunctioning portable speaker from the platform onto the adjacent tracks just as a train is approaching, causing the operator to apply emergency brakes.","This scenario illustrates a violation of the regulation by depicting a specific act of throwing an object onto the railway premises, which could have injured passengers or damaged property, and leading to a situation that endangers individuals and disrupts the railway service.",,
12,"During rush hour at Tanah Merah MRT station in Singapore, a curious commuter jumps over the maintenance barrier and enters the driver's cabin of a stationary train, while the actual driver is busy discussing schedules with the station manager.",This commuter's actions are in violation of the regulation as he is neither authorized nor is the driver's cabin a part designated for the carriage of passengers.,,
13,"At the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station in Singapore, an impatient commuter forcefully opens the train doors with his hands, bypassing the electrical mechanism, as the train is about to depart.","This action is a blatant violation of the regulation as the commuter has improperly used and interfered with electrical equipment that controls the train's doors, posing significant risk to himself and to the operational safety of the railway system.","In an MRT station in Singapore, a person wearing a high-visibility vest is seen using a makeshift tool to adjust the settings on a signaling panel adjacent to the train tracks. The act is quick and goes mostly unnoticed by the bustling crowd.","This scenario violates the regulation as the individual improperly meddles with electrical equipment, a signaling panel, which is crucial for the safe operation of the railway. Even though they are wearing a high-visibility vest, which could imply authority or legitimacy, if they are not authorized personnel, their actions constitute a clear breach of safety protocols and the regulation."
14,"During the rush hour in a busy MRT station in Singapore, a group of young adults, in a dare game, climb and sit atop the handrails of an escalator, laughing and distracting other passengers.","This behavior directly violates the mentioned regulation as it involves individuals sitting on the handrail of an escalator, which is expressly forbidden in the railway premises. The actions pose safety risks to themselves and other passengers and disrupt the orderly use of the escalator.","In a quieter hour at a Singapore MRT station, a street performer sets up a small portable chair on the step of an escalator to sit and play his guitar for the sparse trickle of passengers. Oblivious to the rules, several onlookers pause on the adjacent escalator, occupying steps as they stop to listen and clap along.","This scenario violates the regulation because the street performer is sitting on the step of an escalator and the onlookers are sitting on the steps of the adjacent escalator, all within the railway premises. These actions are clear contraventions of part (a) of the regulation, posing safety risks as they could lead to congestion and accidents on the escalator."
15,"During rush hour at a busy MRT station in Singapore, a man impatiently pushes past commuters and starts sprinting up the down-moving escalator, causing several other passengers to lose their balance.","The man's actions directly violate the regulation as he attempts to travel in the opposite direction of the escalator's movement, thereby endangering himself and others by creating a potential for accidents and disruption in the railway premises.","In the serenity of a Singapore MRT station early on a Sunday morning, a tourist, captivated by the intricate station art, absentmindedly walks up the descending escalator, causing a brief pause in the calm flow of passengers.","Although the scene is calm and the tourist's behavior might be seen as a minor disruption, the act of walking up a descending escalator is a clear violation of the regulation which states that no person should travel in the opposite direction of an escalator's movement on railway premises."
16,"On a busy weekday afternoon, a man at the Bugis MRT station in Singapore frivolously activates the emergency stop button on the platform after a bet with friends, causing confusion and a temporary halt to train services.","The man's actions violate the regulation as he activated an emergency safety device without authority and not for its intended purpose, causing disruption to railway operations and violating safety regulations.",,
17,"During the afternoon rush hour at Orchard Road MRT Station in Singapore, a commuter annoyed by the delayed arrival of the train decides to pry open the platform screen doors manually to signal for assistance, causing immediate alarm and confusion among the fellow passengers.","The commuter's action of manually prying open the platform screen doors violates the regulation, as it is an interference with the doors and they were not used in an emergency situation nor was the commuter an authorized person responding to a duty. It poses a safety risk and contravenes the prohibition against non-emergency tampering with train or platform doors.",,
18,"During rush hour at the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station in Singapore, a street performer unlawfully sets up a large drum set on the platform, playing loudly and causing a crowd to block the pathway, preventing passengers from boarding and disembarking trains safely.","The street performer's act of setting up a drum set on a busy platform creates an obstruction and hindrance to the flow of passengers which is dangerous during peak travel times, thereby violating the stated regulation.",,
19,"After realizing he has lost his MRT card in the paid area of a busy Singapore train station, a commuter promptly informs the station master of the situation but adamantly refuses to pay the administrative charge, insisting instead that he should be allowed to exit without any penalty due to his regular patronage.","This scenario violates the regulation, as the commuter has failed to pay the administrative charge required when reporting a lost ticket. Despite informing the proper authorities, the regulation dictates that the commuter must make a payment before leaving the paid area, which he has neglected to do.",,
20,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, Jane brazenly walked through the wide-open service gate alongside a family with a stroller, without holding a ticket of her own, clearly visible to the passing station manager.","Jane's actions breach [regulation] by entering the paid area of the MRT station without a ticket, openly ignoring the conditions of use which are implicitly agreed upon by anyone acquiring a ticket.","During the rush hour frenzy at a Singapore MRT station, as the station manager was distracted by a tourist asking for directions, John slipped in through the crowd entering the gate, unspotted without a ticket.","This action violates the regulation in that John did not acquire a ticket and therefore did not adhere to the regulations and conditions of use, which he would be deemed to have agreed to by possessing a ticket."
21,"In the Central Business District of Singapore, a commuter notices unadvertised fares being charged by unofficial ticket sellers who have set up a kiosk right beside the official fare tables, which display different, higher prices.","The unofficial ticket sellers are in violation of the regulation by charging fares that have not been authorized or published by the Authority or its licensee, and they are doing so in a manner that competes directly with the officially posted fares at the station.",,
22,"During peak hours at the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station in Singapore, an individual with a valid ticket enters the platform but instead of boarding his designated train, he sits down on the floor near the tracks, engrossed in a book, ignoring the repeated train arrivals and announcements.","This individual violates the regulation by using his ticket to access the platform but not traveling in accordance with the conditions of use, which requires passengers to board trains as intended. His behavior causes a safety risk due to his proximity to the tracks and potential to obstruct other passengers during peak times.",,
23,"In the hustle and bustle of Singapore's Raffles Place MRT station, a commuter in a business suit lingers in the paid area well beyond the prescribed period, blatantly ignoring the repeated announcements and warning signs, as he casually continues a long video call by the turnstiles.",This scenario demonstrates a violation of the regulation as the commuter has no reasonable excuse for remaining in the paid area after the expiry of the prescribed period. The act of ignoring the announcements and warning signs and continuing a non-urgent activity like a video call shows a clear disregard for the regulation.,,
24,"A group of tourists in Paris, relying on the explicitly stated train schedule, miss their international flight back home when the train they planned to catch for the airport is unexpectedly canceled without notice. They demand the rail service compensate them for the additional lodging costs and the new flight tickets.","This scenario illustrates a violation of the regulation as the tourists are expecting the rail service to adhere to the schedule and provide compensation for the losses incurred due to the cancellation of the train, despite the regulation stating there is no such warranty or liability on the part of the rail service provider.",,

It also potentially touches on part (b), as the card is physically damaged in the process, which could be inferred from the smudged print and the card reader's inability to scan it afterward.""}"
27,"On a busy Friday evening at a Singapore MRT station, Sarah uses an old ticket from a previous trip, which she has tampered with by changing the date, to pass through the automatic gates and board the train.",Sarah's actions violate [regulation] because she is attempting to use a ticket which has been improperly altered with the intent to enter the paid area of the railway and travel upon it.,,
28,"In Singapore, a commuter who is approached by a fare inspector within the MRT station openly refuses to show his ticket, claiming that it is his personal property and that the inspector has no right to demand it.","This scenario violates the regulation because the commuter is required by law to produce the ticket upon request as it remains the property of the Authority, not the commuter. By refusing to show the ticket when requested by an authorized person, the commuter is directly contravening the stipulated regulation.","In the bustling morning hours of a Singapore MRT station, a commuter, when asked for his ticket, smilingly hands over a decoy card resembling a valid ticket, maintaining a friendly banter with the inspector to avoid suspicion.","The scenario illustrates a violation where the commuter does not provide the actual ticket owned by the Authority, as required by the regulation. Instead, the commuter uses a decoy card and tries to misdirect the inspector's attention through engaging conversation. This act, while subtle, is a deliberate attempt to circumvent the obligation of displaying the valid property of the Authority when demanded."

Moments later, authorities towed away her car, incurring a removal fee, and left a notice at the registered address.","Melissa's actions violate [regulation] because she parked in a no-parking area which is in contravention of regulation 44, prompting the authority to remove and detain her vehicle. She is now liable for all costs related to the removal, and the authority has followed due process by notifying her of the detention of her vehicle.",,
31,"During peak hour at a busy railway station, a delivery driver hurries through the premises, blatantly driving past several stop signs and ignoring a railway staff member's hand signals directing him to take a different route due to maintenance work.","In this scenario, the delivery driver violates the regulation by failing to obey traffic signs and signals and disregarding the directions of an authorized railway employee, creating potential danger for maintenance workers and passengers.",,

33,"In Singapore, a commuter at a bustling MRT station discovers a high-end smartphone lying on a bench, but instead of surrendering it to the station's service desk, he swiftly pockets the device and exits the station.","The scenario depicts a violation of the regulation as the commuter, upon finding lost property on railway premises, fails to hand it over to an authorized person at the nearest station, as mandated.",,"{'1': ""This scenario subtly depicts a violation of the regulation as the commuter does not report the found pen to the station's authorities, as required by law. The violation might be overlooked by the audience because the commuter is distracted and the action of pocketing the pen could seem unintentional or a reflexive act rather than a deliberate decision.""}"
34,"At Dhoby Ghaut MRT station in Singapore, a commuter notices an expensive-looking watch lying unattended on a bench. He quickly pockets it with the intention to sell it later, ignoring the sign nearby reminding passengers to turn in found items to the station staff.","This scenario violates the regulation by depicting an unauthorized person taking possession of property found on the railway premises with the intention of illegally benefitting from it, rather than handing it over to an authorized person as mandated.","In the bustling Bugis MRT station in Singapore, a passerby swiftly clutches an abandoned phone to his chest when he notices a group of rowdy teenagers eyeing it, concealing it in his jacket with the intent of protecting it until he can find a lost and found.","Despite the passerby's seemingly protective action, the movement of the phone into his personal possession is a clear violation of [regulation], as he is not an authorised person and has moved the property from its location on the railway premises without the purpose of directly handing it over to an authorised person."
35,"In Singapore, an MRT station manager discovers a container labeled as 'Fresh Seafood' left in the lost and found but decides to store it with other non-perishable lost items, ignoring the stench. Three weeks later, commuters complain of a foul smell permeating the station due to the forgotten and decomposed seafood.","The scenario depicts a violation against the regulation regarding perishable goods.

36,"In Singapore, a former owner of a high-valued watch, which was auctioned off by the Authority's licensee due to being unclaimed property, presents valid proof of ownership four months after the sale but is denied any proceeds by the licensee citing administrative costs that exceeded the sale amount.","This scenario violates the [regulation] because it states the previous owner is entitled to the proceeds of the sale less expenses, provided they present proof of ownership within 6 months and offer an indemnity. Refusing to compensate the owner despite meeting these conditions goes against the regulation.","In Singapore, an artist's valuable painting, thought lost and subsequently sold by a licensee, is claimed by the artist with proper documentation two months post-sale; however, the licensee insists, citing a unique and costly restoration process performed pre-auction, that expenses surpassed the auction's revenue, thus retaining the excess.","The scenario describes a situation where the licensee is potentially violating the regulation by withholding sale proceeds from the former owner who has adequately proven ownership within the allowable time frame. Even if the restoration costs were substantial, the regulation explicitly states that the owner is entitled to the proceeds less all expenses. If these expenses are truly exceeding the sale proceeds, this might not comply with the regulatory requirement, making such an action a violation."
37,"In the midst of a turbulent monsoon season, a passenger at a Singapore MRT station drops their expensive watch onto the tracks and subsequently demands compensation from the transport Authority, claiming that it should be responsible for securing passengers' belongings within their premises.","The scenario portrays a violation of the regulation as it highlights a passenger attempting to hold the Authority responsible for their lost property and seeking compensation, which is expressly disclaimed by the regulation stating that neither the Authority nor its licensee are liable for any lost property.","During a city-wide celebration in Singapore, a distracted tourist leaves their laptop bag with important documents at a hawker center, and upon their return, finds it missingâ€”promptly seeking to hold the local authorities accountable. In the commotion, a cleaning staff member had moved it for a routine security sweep and placed it in the lost and found.","[""The scenario suggests that the tourist believes local authorities or their licensees might be held liable for items left unattended, which directly contravenes the stipulation of the regulation that they 'shall have no liability in respect of any lost property.' Despite the sympathetic circumstances of the tourist and the confusion during a celebration, the regulation's provision remains clear about the absence of liability for lost property, indicating a violation in expecting compensation from the authority.""]"
38,"At the bustling Jurong East MRT station in Singapore, several bicycles are haphazardly parked at the main entrance, crowding the walkway and forcing commuters to navigate an obstacle course just to reach the ticket gates.","This scenario violates the regulation as these bicycles are not parked in a designated area within the railway premises and furthermore, their placement impedes the smooth flow of pedestrian traffic, potentially posing a safety hazard.",,
39,"During a bustling weekend at a popular park in Singapore, a cyclist hastily attaches a hastily scribbled note with unintelligible handwriting to the under-seat of his bicycle rather than a conspicuous part, before joining his friends for a picnic.","This action violates the [regulation] because it specifies that a notice must be affixed to a conspicuous part of the bicycle to ensure visibility, and a note placed under the seat fails to meet this criterion. The obscured notice could lead to vital information being missed by other park users, posing a safety hazard and a breach of regulation.",,
40,"During peak hours at the Raffles Place MRT station in Singapore, a delivery rider leaves his bicycle parked at the base of the escalator, causing commuters to dodge around it and creating a bottleneck.","{'explanation': ""The delivery rider's action of parking his bicycle at the base of the escalator directly violates the regulation. It causes an obstruction and inconvenience to the commuters, which is particularly dangerous during peak hours when crowd movements are frequent. According to the regulation, the bicycle should be immediately removed to prevent such inconvenience or safety risks.""}",,
41,"In Singapore, a bicycle owner attempts to forcefully retrieve his confiscated bike from the authorized holding area without settling the fine and the associated expenses imposed by the Land Transport Authority. The owner is caught cutting the lock and trying to ride away on the detained bicycle.","The scenario blatantly violates the regulation by depicting the owner's attempt to recover the detained bicycle without the permission of an authorized person and without paying the necessary expenses, as outlined by the Authority.","[""In Singapore, a decorated and seemingly operational tricycle prominently displayed with an 'Under Repair' sign is left unattended outside an LTA authorised compound, later found missing by an officer.""]","[""This scenario violates [regulation] as it implies the tricycle, which should be under the LTA's detention, was not released by an authorised person nor were the expenses for its removal and detainment settled by the owner before its disappearance.""]"
42,"In a bustling neighborhood of Singapore, a local is caught on camera using a pair of pliers to unchain a detained bicycle that was affixed with an official notice from the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Not far from there, another individual is spotted peeling off a warning sticker from a trishaw parked in a restricted zone, disregarding the clear signage indicating that the vehicle is immobilized by authorities.","The first individual's act of using pliers to unchain a detained bicycle is a direct violation of the regulation as it is an attempt to remove a bicycle from the place where it has been detained without authority. The second individual's removal of an official notice from a trishaw also breaches the law as outlined in the regulation, which prohibits the tampering with any notice affixed under the authority of an authorized person.",,"{'1': ""This scenario illustrates a violation of [regulation] as it involves the removal of an official notice from a bicycle. Although it may appear accidental to bystanders, and potentially overlooked due to the street performer's activities, it constitutes tampering with a notice affixed under paragraph (2) and is therefore an offence.""}"
43,"In Singapore, a month after the Authority issued notices, a collection of unclaimed bicycles remains piled up in a public parking area, causing obstruction and safety hazards as people navigate through the cluttered space.","The scenario depicts a violation of the regulation, as the Authority has failed to dispose of the unclaimed bicycles after the specified one-month period, leading to potential safety risks and obstruction in public areas.",,
44,"During the evening rush hour at a busy MRT station in Singapore, a street performer sets up his equipment on the main concourse, obstructing the thoroughfare and performing loud tricks that distract commuters and create bottlenecks near platform entrances.","The street performer's actions violate the regulation by obstructing railway premises and causing a potential safety hazard for passengers. His unauthorized performance disrupts the normal flow of commuter traffic and poses a distraction that can lead to accidents, thus justifying his removal under the regulation.",,
45,"After a sudden service disruption due to unexpected maintenance, a tourist in Singapore refuses to leave the platform, insisting that the train operator must provide an immediate alternative transport and compensation for the delay.","This scenario illustrates a violation against the regulation as the tourist is failing to accept the exemption from liability on the part of the train operator for service disruptions, which is part of the conditions agreed upon when the ticket was purchased.",,
