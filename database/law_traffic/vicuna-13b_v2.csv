0,"At the Singapore MRT station, despite clear announcements that a security drill is underway and entry to the premises is temporarily restricted, Sarah knowingly attempts to bypass the security tape and force her way in through a closed entrance, ignoring the warnings of the staff.","Sarah's actions intentionally defy the Authority's right, as stated in the regulation, to refuse admission of any person onto the railway premises. Additionally, her attempt to use a closed entrance, which the Authority is allowed to close as it sees fit, results in a violation of both provisions of the regulation.","{'1': ""In the bustling early morning at the Dhoby Ghaut MRT in Singapore, a suited man, clutching his briefcase, ducks under a barrier tape marked 'No Entry' and dashes into a closed-off area of the station, muttering about his urgent meeting.""}","{'1': ""The man's actions in the scenario violate [regulation] as he enters a part of the railway premises that was likely closed for reasons deemed expedient by the Authority or its licensee, who reserve the right to restrict access and refuse admission to any individual at any time, without being liable for any repercussions of the closure.""}"
1,"In the bustling Tanjong Pagar MRT station in Singapore, Sarah, clearly intoxicated, staggers onto the platform, slumping against other passengers awaiting the train, her condition creating unease and risking others' safety.","Sarah violates the regulation as her intoxicated state is expressly prohibited from railway premises according to clause (1) of the regulation. Her behavior is unsafe as it involves physical contact with other passengers, and potentially endangers their safety which the regulation intends to protect.",,"{'ViolationExplanation': ""Marcus's conduct violates [regulation] (1) and potentially (2) as he is in a state of intoxication on railway premises. Although his behavior is not causing immediate disorder, his impaired state can be a hazard to himself and other passengers, especially if his condition worsens or if an emergency arises.""}"
2,"Alex, disregarding the prominent 'No Entry' signs, clambers over the barrier and jogs across the tracks at Tanjong Pagar MRT station to get to the opposite platform, while elsewhere, Eve slips through an open service gate at the Marina Bay interchange avoiding the use of her EZ-Link card.","Alex's action of crossing the tracks violates part (a) of the regulation as it is not an area clearly defined for persons using the railway premises, while Eve's use of the service gate to avoid the ticket gates provided for entry or exit is a violation of part (b) of the regulation.","Ignoring the signs that clearly demarcate the staff-only areas at Raffles Place MRT, Jake hops over the maintenance gate and nonchalantly makes his way onto the restricted service track. On the same day, Lily at Dhoby Ghaut station ducks under the ticket gantry to bypass payment, despite the gate beeping loudly to signal an unauthorized entry.","In this scenario, both Jake and Lily violate the regulation. Jake's act of hopping over the maintenance gate to enter the restricted service track is a clear breach of part (a) of the regulation that prohibits entry into any part of the railway not intended for public use. Lily's action of ducking under the ticket gantry constitutes a violation of part (b) by not using the proper means of ticketing provided to enter or leave the railway premises."
3,"In the crowded Singapore MRT during rush hour, Emily enters with her electric scooter unfolded, its handlebars sticking out obstructing the path, and without having switched it off, causing fellow commuters to dodge around her to avoid getting hit.","{'explanation': ""Emily's actions directly contravene several stipulations of the regulation: the scooter is not folded and its dimensions are not maintained with the longest side vertical, the handlebars threaten the safety of others, and the electric scooter is not switched off which is a clear safety risk.""}","During a quiet afternoon in the Singapore MRT, Jack calmly enters with his foldable bike, the bike neatly folded but slightly exceeding the dimensions at 125 cm by 70 cm by 40 cm. No one at the entrance stops him because the bike appears compact and non-disruptive despite being oversized.","The scenario illustrates a violation where Jack's foldable bike exceeds the allowed dimensions of 120 cm by 70 cm by 40 cm as mentioned in [regulation](b). Although the scenario is subtle and may not draw immediate attention, it presents a clear breach of the rules that someone familiar with the regulation would recognize."
4,"In the bustling peak hour at a Singapore MRT station, Sarah nonchalantly unfolds her electric scooter and begins to ride it through the ticket barrier and down the platform, weaving between the crowd of commuters waiting for the train.","Sarah's actions directly contravene the regulation as she uses her personal mobility device within the railway premises—a clear violation as riding any kind of device is specifically prohibited; moreover, she is in the paid area not for the purpose of using the rail but instead unlawfully rides through it.","At a busy MRT station in Singapore, David, perplexed by the crowd and the signs, accidentally unfolds his bicycle within the paid area, momentarily believing he had to prepare it for the train journey ahead.","David's act of unfolding his bicycle within the paid area of the railway premises is a violation of regulation (b), which states that one must not use or ride a foldable bicycle within the railway premises."
5,"Amanda enters the MRT station in Singapore dragging an unfolded e-scooter with wheels covered in mud, causing several passengers to sidestep hastily to avoid getting dirty.","Amanda's actions violate the regulation because she did not fold her personal mobility device with the longest side in a vertical position and failed to cover the dirty wheels, which could deposit dirt onto the railway premises and soil the clothing of other passengers.","In a bustling MRT station in Singapore, Joshua carelessly wheels his unfolded electric bicycle through the crowded walkways, its motor still whirring softly, as he hurriedly makes his way toward the exit.","Joshua's actions infringe upon the [regulation] in several ways: His electric bicycle is not folded with the longest side in a vertical position, the wheels are not covered to prevent dirt transfer, the motor is not switched off, and by not taking these required safety precautions, he potentially causes inconvenience and obstruction to other passengers."
6,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, Sarah allows her large pet dog, which is neither a guide dog nor a service animal, to run freely through the crowd, causing a chaotic situation where commuters are tripping over the leash.","{'explanation': ""Sarah's actions breach the regulation by bringing an animal onto the railway premises that is not exempted under the specified conditions. Her lack of control over the pet also creates a safety hazard for the commuters, which is against the safety requirements stipulated.""}","In the bustling Tanjong Pagar MRT station in Singapore, Jack carries a small caged bird onto the platform, taking care not to draw attention as he joins a group of tourists. During peak hours at Dhoby Ghaut MRT, Jenny enters with her emotional support cat tucked in her purse and swiftly boards a train, blending in with the crowd.","[""Despite the subtlety of Jack's actions, bringing any caged bird into MRT stations without it being a guide or a service animal authorized by the police or security is a breach of the regulation that prohibits animals on railway premises."", ""Jenny's emotional support cat, although discrete, is not recognized as an exception under the regulation and brings an unauthorized animal onto railway premises, which is a clear violation.""]"

8,"At Singapore's busy Orchard MRT station, Helen climbs onto a stationary train's roof to take dynamic selfies, ignoring the warning signs and the station master's vocal disapproval. Beside her, Tom uses a loudspeaker to lead a raucous group chant opposing a recent government policy, despite clear no-disturbance signage and several requests to stop from security personnel.","Helen's act of climbing onto a train roof breaches regulations as it disobeys both the safety signs and the direct instructions from the station master, posing a risk to her safety and potentially disrupting rail services. Tom's organized chant using a loudspeaker contravenes the regulations as it ignores the no-disturbance signs and fails to heed the authorized security personnel's orders to cease, contributing to disorder and a potential security risk on railway premises.",,"{'1': ""Sara's act of sticking bubble gum under seats violates the regulations concerning maintaining cleanliness on railway premises. The flash mob is non-compliant as it ignores the regulation that mandates following reasonable instructions and signage that likely prohibits such performances in the MRT station.""}"
9,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, Alex casually tosses his used candy wrapper onto the platform floor as he walks towards the train, while Bella discards her chewed gum by sticking it under a bench instead of finding a bin.","Alex is in violation by placing litter upon the railway premises, contrary to clause (a) of the regulation. Bella also violates clause (b) by improperly disposing of her chewing gum on the fittings of the railway premises rather than using a proper receptacle.","In the midst of the bustling Chinatown Complex in Singapore, as the Mid-Autumn Festival decorations brighten the night, Dave discreetly drops his soda can onto the crowded street while blending into the throng of festival-goers, and Claire cunningly sticks her used chewing gum underneath a lantern-decorated table at a busy hawker centre.","In this scenario, Dave's and Claire's actions are in direct violation of the Singaporean regulation that prohibits littering and the disposal of chewing gum in places other than designated receptacles. Despite the subtle nature of their actions amidst the busy environment, they are still accountable for contributing to environmental pollution and potentially causing damage to public property."
10,"During rush hour on a Singapore MRT train, an individual decides to practice their juggling skills with glass bottles, causing frustration and concern among the cramped crowd of commuters.",This scenario violates the regulation as the person's behavior of juggling glass bottles is likely to cause annoyance to other passengers due to the disturbance and potential danger it presents in a crowded space.,"On a late evening in Singapore, a street performer decides to entertain passengers on a less crowded MRT train by calmly playing a harmonica while intermittently blowing a whistle loudly when the doors open at each station.","While the harmonica performance could be seen as entertainment, the loud whistle blowing in a confined space like a train carriage, especially when doors open, could startle other passengers, posing a nuisance and potential safety risk as it may distract or confuse passengers during boarding or alighting, thus violating the regulation."
11,"During a busy weekend at a Singaporean festival close to the railway track, a reveler, frustrated by the long queues for trash disposal, flings a half-eaten plate of chicken rice over the railway barricade, where it lands on the electrified tracks.","This scenario depicts a clear violation of the regulation, as it involves a person actively throwing waste (a half-eaten plate of chicken rice) onto the railway premises, which is capable of endangering property due to the possibility of electrical short-circuiting and inconvenience to the maintenance crew and train services.","At the festive opening of a popular art installation near a Singapore MRT station, a patron, in a whimsical gesture, tosses a metallic souvenir token toward a friend, missing the intended catch and sending it clinking down onto the tracks just as a train approaches.","The act of tossing a metallic object onto railway tracks poses a significant safety risk, as well as the potential to damage property and inconvenience railway operations. This violates the regulation against depositing items onto the railway premises that could cause injury, damage or inconvenience."
12,"During rush hour at a busy Singapore MRT station, Alex, a commuter in a rush to get home, impatiently bypasses the crowded passenger car, jumps over a low barrier, and scrambles into the train's cabin reserved exclusively for the operator.","Alex's actions constitute a clear violation of the regulation as he is neither an authorized person to access the operator's cabin, nor does that part of the train serve as a carriage for passengers.","In a Singapore transport hub, amidst a celebration event with train fanatics taking photos, Jordan cleverly blends in with a group of authorized personnel and steps into a restricted driver's cabin while capturing selfies during a brief train stop.","{'explanation': ""Jordan's actions violate the regulation because Jordan, who is not an authorized person, entered a train's operator cabin, which is not intended for passengers. Although done under the guise of taking selfies during an event, this incursion into a restricted area is illegal and unsafe.""}"
13,"During rush hour at a busy MRT station in Singapore, Dave, ignoring the warning signs, climbs onto a stationary train and starts tampering with the control panel in the driver's cabin, trying to figure out how it works.","Dave's actions violate the regulation by improperly meddling with electrical equipment and interfering with a device operating train equipment, which could potentially compromise the safety and operation of the railway service.","At the bustling Chinatown MRT station in Singapore, a street performer juggles colorful balls outside a train, drawing a large crowd's attention, while his partner subtly fiddles with the exterior door control panel.","The scenario involves improper meddling with mechanical or electrical equipment on railway premises by the partner of the street performer, which clearly violates the regulation that prohibits any form of interference with railway equipment. Although the performer's act of juggling serves as a distraction, it doesn't legitimize his partner's tampering with the control panel."
14,"In a busy Singapore MRT station during rush hour, a teenage skateboarder, ignoring the warning signs, sits on the handrail of an escalator full of commuters and rides down, causing several passengers to step back in alarm.","{'explanation': ""The skateboarder's act of riding the handrail of the escalator directly violates part (b) of the regulation by not only sitting but also riding on a handrail. This behavior creates obvious safety risks for the skateboarder and other passengers, which is a clear infringement of the law stated.""}","At a bustling Singapore MRT station, a performance artist disguised as a silver statue poses motionless atop the handrail of an escalator, intriguing some commuters to take photos while others pass by unconcerned.","Despite the captivating display, the performer is in clear violation of regulation [(1) (b)], as they are sitting on the handrail of an escalator, a breach that poses a safety risk regardless of the public’s reaction."
15,"In the bustling City Hall MRT station in Singapore, Emma, in a rush to catch her train, starts running up the down-going escalator, causing confusion and forcing others to quickly dodge to avoid a collision.","Emma's actions violate [regulation] by travelling on the escalator in the opposite direction of its movement. This not only breaches the regulation but also creates a safety hazard for herself and other commuters, increasing the risk of accidents on the railway premises.","At the serene Botanic Gardens MRT station in Singapore, John nonchalantly walks down the up-going escalator to take a shortcut, unaware of a sign indicating the direction of travel.","John's actions breach the regulation as he is travelling against the direction of the escalator's movement, which could endanger himself and other commuters."
16,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, Chloe casually leans against the emergency stop button of an escalator, triggering its sudden halt, as a prank to startle her friends. Nearby commuters stumble, some nearly falling, as the moving stairs come to an abrupt stop.","By intentionally activating the emergency stop button on the escalator without any real emergency or safety need, Chloe violates the regulation which prohibits the use of safety devices for any purpose other than their intended use. Her unauthorized act endangered the safety of the commuters and disrupted the operation of railway premises.","{'1': ""In a bustling Singapore shopping mall, a street performer playfully balances on the edge of a subway platform's emergency call point, accidentally pressing it with his back during his act, causing the security to rush over.""}","{'1': ""The performer, not being an authorised person, activated an emergency device - the platform's emergency call point - for a purpose other than its intended use.

17,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, Alice, impatient with the train delays, reaches out and forcibly holds the train door open to shout at a staff member, preventing the door from closing and the train from departing.","Alice's actions violate the regulation by interfering with the operation of a train door when there is no emergency, and she is not an authorized person acting in the discharge of her duties. Her behavior directly impacts the operation of the train and presents a safety concern.","During the rush hour at a Singapore MRT station, Ben, while wearing a high-visibility vest, uses a clipboard to wedge a platform screen door open, claiming he's conducting a quick survey on passenger satisfaction before the train departs.","This scenario depicts a violation of the specific regulation as Ben, regardless of his attire or claim of surveying, is interfering with the platform screen door's operation outside of an emergency situation or without being an authorized person fulfilling their duties."
18,"On a hot afternoon, a street busker, eager to entertain the crowds at the bustling Dhoby Ghaut MRT interchange in Singapore, sets up his elaborate drum set on the narrow walkway connecting the North-South line to the North-East line, causing pedestrians to squeeze past him or dangerously step close to the tracks to get by.","The busker's act of setting up a drum set in a busy pathway causes an obstruction and poses a hindrance to passengers moving between the MRT lines, which is a violation of the regulation that prohibits causing any obstruction, hindrance, or danger on the railway premises.",,
19,"After losing his ticket in a Singapore MRT station, Marcus casually mentions the loss to a transit officer but declines to pay the administrative charge or provide detailed information about the ticket loss, and proceeds to exit through a service gate left ajar by a maintenance worker.","This scenario violates [regulation] as Marcus fails to pay the required administrative fee and does not satisfy the Authority or its licensee with the appropriate evidence of his ticket loss before leaving the paid area, instead taking advantage of an incidental opportunity to exit.","In a rush to attend to her sick child, Hannah explains her lost MRT ticket situation to the staff at a Singapore station, receives sympathetic nods, but steps out without paying the administrative charge as she catches sight of her visibly distressed child outside the paid area.","Although Hannah seems to have a compelling reason to quickly exit the paid area, her actions still constitute a violation of the regulation which requires individuals to pay an administrative charge upon reporting a lost ticket before leaving the paid area."
20,"On a busy weekday in Singapore, John casually slips through the train station's barrier with a group of passengers, using an expired tourist pass while knowing it ceased being valid days ago.","John's action of using an expired tourist pass to gain access to the train is a violation of the regulation, which holds that passengers are deemed to have agreed to the regulations and conditions of use upon ticket acquisition, which includes using a valid ticket for travel.","In a bustling Singapore mall, Alice subtly bypasses the ticketing gate at the MRT station, flashing a smile at the attendant while knowingly using her friend's concession card despite it being non-transferable.","Alice's intentional misuse of a concession card, specifically meant for her friend only, violates the regulation that stipulates individuals acquiring or using a ticket must adhere to the terms and conditions associated with it, including non-transferability."
21,"At the bustling central metro station, a group of ticket scalpers offer daily commuters hand-written 'discounted' passes that undercut the official fares displayed at the ticket kiosks.",This scene depicts a clear violation of the regulation as the ticket scalpers are not the Authority or its licensee and are distributing unauthorized fares that have not been published and posted at the station by the Authority.,"During the Singapore National Day celebrations at a busy MRT station, several individuals blend into the crowd, quietly offering electronic tickets via a mobile app that claims to provide discounted rates for the day's festivities.","This scenario violates the regulation because the individuals are distributing fares that are not posted and authorized by the officially designated Authority or its licensee. By using an unofficial mobile app to sell discounted tickets, they are circumventing the regulated fare system."
22,"Emma, after boarding the express train with an 'off-peak hours' ticket, finds a quiet spot in the First Class carriage during the crowded morning rush. She settles in, ignoring the conductor's reminder that her ticket is not valid for this time and class of service.","Emma's entrance and occupancy of the First Class carriage during peak hours conflict with the conditions of her 'off-peak' ticket, as she is travelling in a carriage and at a time not covered by her ticket. Her disregard for the conductor's warning underlines her intentional violation of the ticket's terms.","{'1': ""Amid a sudden downpour in Singapore, soaked and desperate to get home, Adrian sneaks into the SMRT's first-class cabin with a standard adult fare card, not noticing the disapproving glances of a uniformed officer seated nearby.""}","{'1': ""This scenario illustrates a violation of the regulation as Adrian, holding a regular ticket, is intentionally traveling in the first-class cabin which his fare does not permit. The presence of the uniformed officer signifies that Adrian's action is a clear infraction, despite the distracting circumstances of his entry being driven by the urgency to escape the rain.""}"
23,"Bob, having finished his shopping, decided to sit down and enjoy the air conditioning in the airport's paid area beyond the time allowed, ignoring the announcements to leave or pay the stipulated administrative charge.","Bob's deliberate choice to remain in the airport's paid area beyond the prescribed time without paying the administrative charge violates the regulation. This clearly demonstrates disregard for the rules, as he had no reasonable excuse for his extended stay.",,
24,"In Singapore, a few minutes before train departure, the official ticketing app of the Authority sends out a notification confirming reserved seating on a peak hour train, only to find that upon boarding, passengers with confirmed seats are required to stand due to overbooking.","This scenario violates [regulation] because the Authority, by confirming reserved seats through its app, implies an assurance of seating availability, which is not warranted as per the regulation. Thus, by overbooking, the Authority fails to honor the implied promise made through the app, misleading passengers regarding the service they can expect.",,
25,"During an unexpected power failure in Singapore's MRT system, the train service licensee announces over the public address system that passengers must pay a surcharge upon exiting the station due to the increased operational costs incurred during the disruption, explicitly promising to issue refunds once services are fully restored.","This scenario illustrates a violation of [regulation] because the Authority or its licensee, under the guise of managing a system failure, imposes an additional financial burden on passengers with a promise of refunds which is not mandated by the regulation. The regulation gives them the power to suspend or alter services without liability for loss or damage, but does not permit the imposition of new, arbitrary charges in such events.",,
26,"During a busy morning at a Singapore MRT station, a commuter frustrated with frequent train delays, scratches off part of the magnetic stripe on his issued transit card in protest, making it unreadable by the card readers.","This scenario illustrates a violation of [regulation] because the commuter has damaged the ticket by erasing part of the coded data on the magnetic stripe, which is explicitly prohibited under the regulation concerning the alteration or interference with tickets.",,
27,"At an MRT station in Singapore, John deliberately uses a friend's expired student concession card to avoid paying the correct fare, even though the card has a faded photo and the expiry date is clearly shown as last month.","This scenario exemplifies a violation of [regulation] because John is attempting to use an expired ticket (student concession card) to enter the paid area and travel upon the railway, which is explicitly prohibited under the regulation.","In a busy Singapore MRT station, during a public holiday rush, Sarah hands over her monthly pass to enter, not realizing it had expired the day before due to the month having one less day than usual. Amidst the crowd, the gate officer, preoccupied with managing the flow, overlooks the expiry date and lets her through.","This scenario violates the regulation because Sarah uses an expired ticket to enter the paid area of the railway. The expiry of the monthly pass is also not immediately apparent due to the unusual circumstance of the month having one less day, which might typically be overlooked by both the passenger and the gate officer during a busy period."
28,"A commuter in Singapore is fined for not having a ticket during a random inspection, even though earlier that day a train officer insisted on keeping their ticket as a souvenir, claiming it was a special commemorative issue.","This scenario violates [regulation] because the ticket, which should remain the property of the Authority and be produced upon demand, was wrongly taken by an officer thus preventing the commuter from complying with the regulation.","{'1': ""A passenger on the MRT is approached by a friendly inspector who, impressed by the artistic design on the ticket, jokingly exchanges his official badge for the ticket as a 'trade'.""}",
29,"On a sweltering afternoon in Singapore, an impatient driver, late for his meeting, hastily parks his luxury sedan right at the entrance of the Jurong East MRT station and dashes off without seeking any permission.",The driver's act of leaving his vehicle at the entrance of the MRT station is a clear violation of the regulation that forbids any person from leaving vehicles on railway premises or station approach roads without the written consent of the Authority or its licensee.,"During a major charity event at Marina Bay Sands, a distracted tourist inadvertently leaves his rental scooter blocking the service entrance of the Bayfront MRT, causing a slight bottleneck.","This scenario violates the regulation because the tourist leaves a vehicle, in this case a rental scooter, unattended in an area controlled by the railway authority without seeking permission, thus potentially creating a safety hazard and obstructing the service entrance."
30,"In Singapore, after detaining a vehicle for parking illegally, the Authority neglects to inform the registered owner about the vehicle's detention and fails to provide the location where the vehicle is being held.","{'explanation': ""This scenario illustrates a violation of [regulation] as it shows the Authority failing to adhere to its obligation of notifying the registered owner of the detained vehicle, which is required 'as soon as practicable' according to the provided regulation.""}","In Singapore, a motorist's car is towed due to a parking violation, and while the Authority places a standard notice on the dashboard before towing, they fail to send the required follow-up notice with the location of the detained vehicle.","This scenario violates regulation 44 because, although a notice was placed on the vehicle, which could be seen as a form of notification, the Authority did not fulfill their obligation to personally or post a notice to the registered owner informing them of the detention and the place of detention, as required by the regulation."
31,"At the bustling Jurong East MRT station in Singapore, Dave nonchalantly drives his delivery scooter down the crowded pedestrian underpass, ignoring the 'No Vehicles' sign and weaving through surprised commuters while honking for them to give way.","Dave's act of driving a vehicle through a pedestrian area, especially in an MRT station, is a clear violation of the regulation as he neither obeys the 'No Vehicles' traffic sign nor the reasonable directions likely given by station staff to not drive in pedestrian designated areas.","During the late-night hours at Singapore's iconic Marina Bay Sands, a security guard hurriedly rides an electric unicycle through the bustling hawker centre, bypassing tourists and locals alike, as he rushes towards an alleged incident on the other side.","Even though the security guard might be responding to an incident, riding a vehicle (electric unicycle) through a crowded hawker centre violates the regulation that requires all vehicle drivers to obey traffic signs and the instructions of the authorized personnel, and it poses a safety risk to pedestrians."
32,"During a high-intensity car chase, a notorious criminal speeds through the grounds of the Singapore Railway Corporation, narrowly missing maintenance workers on site and causing onlookers to gasp at the perilous situation.","This scenario violates the regulation by having a vehicle – the criminal's car – travel at a rate of speed and in a manner that is liable to involve danger to others, including the maintenance workers and onlookers, on the railway premises.",,
33,"Exiting a train at Singapore's Marina Bay station, Emma discovers a wallet brimming with cash on a bench but, instead of notifying station personnel, slips it into her pocket while assessing its contents.","Emma violates the regulation by not handing over the found wallet with cash to an authorized person at the station as required, demonstrating both the disregard for property rights and the regulations that mandate the safeguarding of lost items.","[""While waiting for his connecting train at Singapore's bustling Orchard station, John finds a digital camera left on a seat. In the midst of a swarm of commuters, he hastily pockets the camera, planning to review the photos to determine its owner.""]","[""Despite John's seemingly good intention to identify the owner by looking through the photos, his actions are in violation of the regulation which mandates that any found property should be immediately handed over to station personnel. This scenario distracts from the violation with the apparent aim of returning the camera to its rightful owner, which could cause the general audience to overlook the breach of regulation.""]"
34,"At the bustling Woodlands MRT station in Singapore, a passenger notices an unattended smartphone on a bench and swiftly pockets it before dashing onto an arriving train.","The passenger's action of taking the smartphone violates the regulation that forbids anyone other than an authorized person to remove lost or left-behind property from railway premises unless it is with intention of handing it over to an authorised person, which did not occur in this scenario.","In a busy hawker centre in downtown Singapore, a diner spots an expensive-looking watch on an adjacent empty table, picks it up to take a closer look, and then walks away with it, intending to find the owner themselves.","The scenario violates [regulation] because the individual removed lost property from the railway premises without being authorized, and despite seemingly good intentions, failed to hand it over to an authorized person."
35,"A Singaporean train station's lost and found office, managed by the Authority's licensee, holds an auction for unclaimed items, including electronics and clothing, just one month after the items were turned in, claiming a need to free up space quickly. Citizens who come looking for their lost belongings prior to the three-month deadline are told those items may have already been sold.","This scenario illustrates a violation of [regulation] as the Authority's licensee fails to retain the lost items for the required period of 3 months, instead opting to auction them off after only one month, disregarding the regulation and potentially depriving the rightful owners of the opportunity to reclaim their property.","Due to a sudden infestation of pests, a Singaporean metro station managed by the Authority or its licensee holds an immediate sale of found items, claiming health and safety concerns, just two weeks after the items were collected. Travelers passing through the station are informed that unclaimed belongings are being cleared out for public safety.","The scenario involves the premature disposal of lost items by sale before the mandated 3-month period, under the pretense of a pest infestation posing a health and safety risk. However, citizens acquainted with the specific regulation would recognize that this act contradicts subsection (b) that prescribes a 3-month retention period for non-perishable items before they can be sold or otherwise disposed of."
36,"In Singapore, a man who presented undeniable evidence and an indemnity form for a watch sold at a public auction 4 months prior, is denied any proceeds by the auctioning Authority, despite the watch fetching a high sum.","This scenario violates the regulation as the former owner provided proof of ownership and indemnity within the 6-month period, entitling him to the sale proceeds minus expenses, but the Authority failed to comply with their obligation.","In Singapore, after a public auction, where a luxury car previously seized by the Authority fetched a remarkable price, a woman who provided conclusive documentation proving ownership and an appropriate indemnity form within 5 months is distracted by a prolonged, complex administrative process and has not received any proceeds.","This scenario violates the regulation as it details a situation where the Authority did not comply by reimbursing the proven owner of the luxury car the proceeds from the sale after proper documentation and an indemnity form had been timely submitted, which is required within 6 months of the sale."
37,"At a Singapore metro station, the Authority's licensee sets up a 'Lost Property Assistance Booth' claiming to assist passengers in tracking lost items, yet conspicuously disclaims any legal responsibility for such items at the bottom of the registration form.","This scenario illustrates a violation of [regulation] by creating a perception that the Authority or its licensee is aiding in the recovery of lost property despite legally denying any liability, as the assistance may imply a form of accountability that does not exist.",,

Unbeknownst to Elaine, the site is part of the railway premises where no parking is allowed, save for clearly marked zones.""]","[""The scenario violates the regulation as it involved Elaine parking her trishaw within the railway premises, as part of the construction site is under the control of the Authority or its licensee, which is not a designated parking area. Despite her belief that parking by the fence was permissible, it was not in an area allocated for such use, thus Elaine's actions are non-compliant with the specified rules.""]"

This modification goes unnoticed until a traffic enforcement officer stops him for the missing notice.","David's actions violate the regulation by removing the notice that should have been conspicuously displayed on his bicycle.
