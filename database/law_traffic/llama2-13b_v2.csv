0,"Despite repeated announcements of a temporary closure due to a security threat, a determined commuter jumps over the barricade and dashes onto the platform at a bustling Singapore MRT station, ignoring the station staff's attempts to prevent entry.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves an individual gaining access to railway premises after the Authority or its licensee has decided to close the entry, directly disregarding the regulations in place for safety and security reasons.","During the festive Chinese New Year period, a group of performers in a dragon costume cleverly disguise their unauthorized entry into a Singapore MRT station by blending with the parade crowd and end up dancing onto the platform. Despite the lively atmosphere, they bypass the usual security checks.","This scenario violates [regulation], as the performers, through their disguised entry, do not comply with the Authorityâ€™s right to refuse admittance and compromise the controlled access intended for security checks and the safety of railway premises."
1,"At a lively New Year's Eve party in Singapore, a group of friends, heavily intoxicated after hours of celebration, stumble into the MRT station, laughing and shouting loudly, with one of them vomiting on the floor next to the ticket barriers.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves persons in an intoxicated state entering and remaining on the railway premises, disrupting the environment and creating unhygienic conditions that pose a risk to the safety and comfort of other passengers.","In the bustling heart of Singapore's Clarke Quay district, a man, reeking of alcohol, clumsily boards the last MRT train of the night, slumping into his seat with a stained shirt that brushes against other passengers' clothes.","This scenario violates the regulation because the man is clearly in an intoxicated state due to the smell of alcohol and his clumsy behavior, and his stained shirt poses a risk of soiling other passengers' clothing, which is prohibited on railway premises as per clause (2) of the [regulation]."
2,"During a busy weekday rush in Singapore, a group of friends, on a dare, climbs over the ticket gates of an MRT station without tapping their transit cards and proceeds to play a game of tag on the tracks, ignoring the clearly marked passenger boundaries.","This scenario violates the regulation by showing individuals entering railway premises without proper use of ticket gates and being in parts of the railway not designated for public use, presenting a clear danger to themselves and disrupting rail services.","In Singapore, a YouTuber recording a 'hidden camera' prank bypasses the MRT's ticket barrier using a false panel mimicking the station's wall, surprising commuters on the other side without using the official entry point.",The scenario portrays a person contravening section (b) of [regulation] by neither using the ticket gates for entry nor following the directions of authorized personnel; the prankster uses an unauthorized and deceptive means to access the railway premises.
3,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, a commuter unfolds a full-sized electric scooter to ride through the concourse, unaware that the handlebars protrude dangerously as they narrowly miss a passerby, and the wheels leave a trail of mud from the recent rain.","This scenario violates the regulation as the personal mobility device is not folded, exceeds the size limits, poses a danger with its protruding handlebars, is not switched off, and soils the railway premises with muddy wheels.","In a Singapore MRT station, a commuter is seen carrying a neatly folded electric kick-scooter with its motor switched on, quietly whirring as they walk towards the platform. The scooter's folded dimensions appear slightly larger than the allowed size, challenging the keen observer to estimate its measurements.","The commuter violated [regulation] as they brought a folded personal mobility device into the MRT station with the electric motor switched on, which is against paragraph (e), and by having a scooter that seems to exceed the permitted dimensions, challenging paragraph (b)."
4,"In the bustling heart of Singapore, an individual lingers in the paid area of an MRT station, casually chatting with friends while their unfolded electric scooter sits beside them. Shortly after, feeling impatient, they hop on the e-scooter and ride through the crowded concourse to exit the station, weaving between commuters.","This scenario violates the regulation as the person is not in the paid area for the purposes of using the railway since they are socializing instead. Furthermore, they violate the second condition by using their personal mobility device within the confines of the railway premises.","On a serene weekday afternoon in Singapore, an individual enters the paid area of a sparsely populated MRT station with a personal mobility device folded under their arm, ostensibly waiting for a train. They unfold the scooter, ostensibly to check its functionality, without riding it, creating a potential obstruction in the process.","Even though the individual does not ride the mobility device, the act of unfolding it within the paid area of an MRT station is a subtle violation of the regulation that requires these devices to remain folded within railway premises unless the person is using the railway for transport. Furthermore, the unfolded scooter impeding the flow of passenger traffic contravenes part (b) of the regulation, which prohibits the use or ride of such devices within the railway premises."
5,"During rush hour at a busy MRT station in Singapore, a commuter enters with an unfolded electric scooter dripping mud from its wheels onto the clean station floor, ignoring the staff's instructions to fold and cover it while hurrying to catch the train. As the commuter rushes through the crowd, the protruding handlebars bump into multiple passengers, creating a hazard and causing discomfort.","This scenario violates the regulation as the commuter failed to fold the electric scooter and cover the muddy wheels thus soiling the railway premises, and did not enclose the protruding handlebars which resulted in inconvenience and potential harm to other passengers, despite being instructed by the authorized personnel.","At an MRT station in Singapore, a passenger with artistic paint on his hands enters carrying an unfolded bicycle with wheels visibly smeared in paint, leaving a creative trail on the platform. He cheerfully waves off concerned staff, who try to remind him to fold his bike and clean the wheels.","{'violation_explanation': ""The scenario violates [regulation] as the passenger failed to comply with multiple parts of the regulation: he did not fold the bicycle, the wheels were not covered which resulted in soiling the premises, and the passenger ignored the staff's reminder, indicating a failure to comply with a condition under paragraph (3).""}"
6,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, a commuter flouts the regulations by walking onto the platform with a leashed cat, disregarding the posted signs prohibiting pets. Shortly after, the cat slips away from the leash, causing a commotion as passengers try to avoid or catch it, which distracts attention from the incoming train.","This scenario violates the regulation by bringing an animal, a cat in this instance, onto the railway premises, which is against paragraph (1). Additionally, by allowing the cat to escape, the owner causes a distraction that poses a safety risk to other passengers and creates a potential for harm or damage, undermining paragraph (2) by not having effective control over the animal.",,
7,"At the bustling Tanjong Pagar MRT station in Singapore, a commuter inadvertently enters the station carrying a portable camping stove for a planned park barbecue later, unaware that the fuel canister attached is considered a flammable substance prohibited by railway safety regulations.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves bringing a dangerous and flammable object into the railway premises, which poses a safety risk. The commuter's actions, despite being inadvertent, contravene the conditions of use that prohibit such items being brought onto the premises by someone unauthorized.",,
8,"At a busy Singapore MRT station, an overzealous busker sets up his performance right under a 'No Busking' sign, blocking the flow of passengers and ignoring the repeated requests of an MRT service staff member to move to a designated area.","This scenario displays a violation of the regulation because the busker fails to comply with the sign explicitly stating 'No Busking' and disregards the reasonable directions of an authorized MRT staff member, both required by the regulation.","In an interlinked corridor of a Singaporean MRT station, a magician subtly performs card tricks, cleverly positioned halfway between the crowded walkway and the archway of a 'No Performances' sign, skillfully attracting a small group of onlookers that partially obstructs the flow of pedestrians.","Despite the magician's strategic positioning and the less obvious obstruction, the gathering of onlookers in a transit area violates the directive to keep clear passageways and disregards the 'No Performances' sign, contravening the rule that every person must follow all notices and reasonable directions on railway premises."
9,"An impatient commuter, running late for an appointment, carelessly discards a banana peel onto the floor of an MRT carriage in Singapore instead of using the bin provided. Additionally, a group of teenagers on the same carriage pop their chewing gum and stick it under the seats as they alight at their stop.","The scenario depicts two distinct violations of the regulation: the commuter's act of littering by throwing the banana peel onto the carriage floor and the teenagers' placement of chewed gum under train seats, both of which undermine the cleanliness regulations for Singapore's railway premises.","During the bustling morning commute on the Singapore MRT, a businessman in a rush inadvertently drops his used train ticket on the platform instead of a trash bin. In that same instant, a teenager, engrossed in her phone, fails to notice her candy wrapper slip from her lap and onto the seat as she stands to disembark.","The businessmanâ€™s action of dropping the train ticket and the teenagerâ€™s accidental littering of a candy wrapper are both violations of the specific regulation stated as they did not use designated receptacles for their litter. The regulation clearly states that no litter should be thrown or placed upon railway premises except into receptacles provided for that purpose, making both individuals in these scenarios non-compliant with the law."
10,"On a crowded MRT train in Singapore, a passenger begins to loudly play music without using headphones, while another one starts eating a durian fruit, causing discomfort and complaints from surrounding passengers.","This scenario violates the regulation because the loud music and the eating of durian, which has a strong smell, are both causing a nuisance or annoyance to other passengers on the train.","In the tranquil cabin of a Singapore MRT late at night, a passenger begins to practice a yoyo trick repeatedly, letting it hit the floor with a thud each time, while others are trying to rest.","The action of practicing a yoyo trick and causing repetitive thudding noises disrupts the quiet environment intended for passengers' rest, thereby constituting a nuisance or annoyance in violation of the train conduct regulation."
11,"A group of rebellious teenagers in Singapore, frustrated after their football match was cancelled, deliberately hurl their sports shoes from an overpass onto the railway tracks below, leading to a temporary suspension of train services.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves throwing objects capable of endangering or inconveniencing persons or property, specifically by causing an interruption in train services due to objects on the tracks.","In an attempt to create a viral social media challenge, a duo in Singapore's bustling Orchard Road dangles a pair of sneakers tied together by the laces from a pedestrian bridge, laughing as they accidentally drop them onto the MRT tracks below.","Despite the initial appearance of a harmless social media challenge, the act of dropping shoes onto railway tracks intentionally or accidentally still violates the regulation. It involves depositing an object capable of endangering railway operations and inconveniencing both passengers and staff, thus meeting the elements of the offense under the specified law."
12,"At a busy Singapore MRT station, an adventurous tourist disregards the signs and slips through an unauthorized staff-only door leading to the front cabin of the train, in an attempt to capture a unique video of the subway tunnels.","This scenario violates the regulation by having an unauthorized person enter a part of the train not intended for passengers, which presents safety risks and contravenes the clearly stated rules against such action.","During a staged emergency drill in a Singapore MRT station, an actor playing a stray passenger ducks under the caution tape and slips into the driver's cabin, pretending to look for an escape route.","The scenario depicts a violation of the regulation by having a person (albeit an actor during a drill) enter an unauthorized part of the train meant only for staff. Despite the context of an emergency drill, the regulation is still breached as the cabin is not designated for passengers."
13,"On a bustling weekday in Singapore, a commuter frustrated with delays pries open an MRT service panel and attempts to reset the train schedule himself. Meanwhile, another passenger, curious about the mechanism of the doors, uses a pen to poke into the edge of a closed door sensor, causing the door to malfunction.","This scenario describes two breaches of the regulation: First, an individual tampering with an MRT service panel, which is unauthorized use or meddling with electrical equipment on the railway premises. Second, a passenger interfering with the sensor of a train door, which constitutes meddling with a mechanical device controlling railway equipment.","In the heart of Singapore's business district, a tourist, mistaking the emergency stop lever for a handrail, gives it a hefty pull out of curiosity, halting the MRT train abruptly.","Even though the tourist may not have intended to cause harm, pulling the emergency stop lever interferes with the train's operation, which constitutes a violation of the regulation that prohibits meddling with mechanical equipment on the railway premises."
14,"In a bustling Singapore MRT station during peak hours, a group of teenagers daring each other to perform stunts foolishly chooses to ride down the escalator handrails, while another tired passenger sits on the steps of the crowded travelator, oblivious to the inconvenience caused to others.","This scenario violates the regulation as it depicts individuals engaging in prohibited behavior on escalators and travelators within railway premises â€” including sitting on the steps of a travelator and riding on the handrails of an escalator, which are both explicitly forbidden acts under the given regulation.",,"{'1': ""The scenario violates [regulation] because it includes an individual sitting on the steps of a travelator and another person riding the handrail of an escalator within the railway premises. Despite the added context of a sudden downpour and sense of urgency, these actions remain inconsiderate to others and unsafe, aligning with the regulation's intent to prevent such behavior in railway premises.""}"
15,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, a daring teenager trying to impress his friends runs up the down-moving escalator, causing confusion and near collisions with commuters descending the escalator.","This scenario violates the regulation as it features an individual intentionally traveling against the direction of the moving escalator, creating a safety hazard and potentially causing harm to others.","In a bustling Singapore MRT station, an absorbed tourist steps onto the descending escalator while mistakenly looking at his map in the wrong direction. Oblivious to the admonitory signs, he bumps into several commuters heading downwards, causing mild disarray.","In this scenario, the tourist violates the regulation by attempting to travel in the opposite direction on an escalator, as prohibited by local law. This contravenes the specific regulation mentioned that no person shall travel on a moving escalator in a direction contrary to its movement, leading to potential safety hazards."
16,"At a busy Singapore MRT station, in a bid to win a dare from his friends, a teenager pulls the fire alarm lever, causing unnecessary panic and the deployment of emergency services.","This scenario violates the regulation because the teenager, who is not authorized to use the emergency device, activated the fire alarm without a legitimate safety concern, misusing the device for a dare and not following the instructions or intended purpose.","During a bustling weekend at a Singapore shopping mall, a store manager mistakenly hits the emergency shut-off button for the escalators, thinking it was the light switch, leading to confusion and slight injuries as shoppers stumble over the sudden halt.","The activation of an emergency device without legitimate reason, even though it was by accident, directly violates the regulation. Despite appearing as a simple mistake, the store manager was not authorised to use the device in this manner, nor was there an emergency to warrant its use."
17,"On a busy weekday in Singapore, a passenger annoyed at missing their stop prises open the trainâ€™s platform screen door with an umbrella, causing a delay and alarm among the other commuters.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves a person interfering with the train's platform screen door using an unauthorized implement (an umbrella), which is neither in an emergency situation nor an action taken by an authorized individual in the line of duty.","During the morning commute on Singapore's MRT, a distracted passenger inadvertently leans against the emergency door release button at the City Hall station, causing the platform screen door to open as the train approaches.",Leaning against the emergency door release button and causing a platform screen door to open is a violation of the regulation which states no one should interfere with the operation of the door unless it's an emergency or they are an authorized person carrying out their duties.
18,"During the rush hour in a Singapore MRT station, a passenger sets down a large suitcase at the foot of the escalator to tie his shoelace, unaware that the suitcase is blocking the path and causing other commuters to trip over.","This scenario violates the regulation by placing an object (the large suitcase) in a way that it obstructs other passengers and creates danger, leading to potential accidents on the railway premises.",,
19,"In a rush to exit the MRT station in Singapore, Alex, having just realized he lost his transit card, bypasses the ticketing office without reporting the loss or paying the administrative charge, ducking under the exit turnstile and joining the flowing crowd outside.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves a person on the transit premises who has lost their transit card and chooses to exit the paid area without following the required procedure of reporting the loss, convincing the authority, and paying the administrative charge.",,"{'1': ""Sophie's hasty exit in the scenario suggests that she did not stop to report the loss of her ticket nor pay the administrative charge in the chaos, therefore violating the regulation.""}"
20,"At the conclusion of an international cricket match at Singapore's stadium, a spectator who had purchased a ticket proceeds to climb over the designated safety barriers and runs across the field, interrupting the award ceremony.","This scenario violates [regulation] because the act of climbing over safety barriers and disrupting the event is against the conditions presumably accepted by the ticket holder upon purchase. The regulation implies that the spectator, by virtue of acquiring a ticket, has agreed to respect the rules and boundaries set by the event organizers.","{'1': ""During a bustling food festival in downtown Singapore, a patron who had purchased a pass for an exclusive culinary demonstration veers off the marked attendee walkways, bypassing a 'Staff Only' sign to shortcut through the kitchen area, oblivious to the event's terms agreed upon with the ticket purchase.""}","{'1': ""The scenario shows a violation of [regulation] where the patron's actions contravene the conditions agreed to upon acquiring the ticket. By entering an unauthorized 'Staff Only' area, the patron breaches the regulations concerning restricted areas and demonstrates a lack of regard for safety measures put in place by the event organizers.""}"
21,"At an MRT station in Singapore, a group of tourists is observed exchanging handmade tickets at a price lower than the authorized fares posted near the ticketing machines. These tickets bear a resemblance to the official ones but showcase the skyline of Singapore as an unofficial feature.",This scenario violates the regulation as it involves the use of tickets that have not been published and therefore not authorized by the railway authority. The sale of these tickets also does not adhere to the set fares that are officially posted at the station.,"{'Generated Scenario': ""At a festive street fair in Singapore's Chinatown, a booth cleverly disguised as a transportation heritage exhibit charges visitors for limited-edition passes featuring vintage MRT designs, which are subtly implied to offer one-time MRT access at a discounted rate.""}","{'Explanation': ""This scenario violates the regulation as it promotes the sale of 'limited-edition passes' without clear authorization, potentially misleading customers into believing they are purchasing valid tickets for MRT travel at lower rates than the authorized fares, and thereby committing fare evasion.""}"
22,"At an MRT station in Singapore, a commuter, disregarding the clear signage, leaps over the barrier and rushes down the escalator the wrong way to chase after a departing train, causing confusion and risk to other passengers.","This scenario violates the regulation as it shows a person traveling upon the railway in a manner not in accordance with the conditions of use, specifically by bypassing barriers and using the escalator in a dangerous and incorrect way.","In the hustle of rush hour at a Singapore MRT station, a passenger, absorbed in their phone, slips through the service gate without scanning their ticket, blending into the crowd boarding the train.","The passenger has failed to travel in accordance with the conditions of use, which require a valid ticket to be scanned as part of entering and exiting the railway, thus violating the regulation."
23,"After shopping at an adjacent mall, a commuter in Singapore re-enters the MRT station paid area to use the restrooms, and then becomes absorbed in a book at the station cafe, inadvertently staying past the prescribed time limit.","The commuterâ€™s actions are in violation of the regulation because he remained in the paid area for a reason other than commuting, extending his stay beyond the allowed period without any reasonable excuse, imposing upon him the requirement to pay an administrative charge.",,"{'1': ""The tourist violated the regulation by entering and staying within the paid area without proper payment and beyond the allowed time. Singapore's MRT regulations require travelers to pay an administrative charge if they stay past the prescribed limit without a valid reason. Using the area as a shelter without payment is not considered a valid excuse.""}"
24,"A businessman hastily purchases a last-minute ticket at a Singapore train station using an automated kiosk, but the train departs abruptly before the ticket is printed, leaving him stranded on the platform. An announcer clarifies that the next train will be delayed due to unforeseen maintenance issues, without offering any restitution or guarantees for his missed connection.","This scenario shows a violation of the regulation as the Authority did not warrant a successful transaction before train departure nor accommodate the passengerâ€™s expectation of prompt service, which left the passenger without recourse when his travel plans were disrupted.",,"{'1': ""This scenario portrays a violation of [regulation] by illustrating that the system's failure to issue a ticket during maintenance does not guarantee that the ticket can be granted before any particular train's departure. It also subtly introduces a routine technology failure which does not explicitly promise the commuter a service, thereby technically observing the letter of the regulation.""}"
25,"In the middle of the bustling Lunar New Year celebrations in Singapore, a group of passengers at a central MRT station refuse to leave a train that has been announced by the operator to be discontinued for the day, demanding that it completes its usual route and causing further delays in the tight train schedule.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves passengers preventing the authority from exercising its discretion to suspend, discontinue or otherwise withdraw train services from a station or alter train schedules, which they are authorized to do without incurring liability.",,
26,"In Singapore, a disgruntled commuter, angry at the train delays, uses a lighter to burn the edges of his electronic train ticket, rendering the ticket's QR code partially unreadable.","{'explanation': ""This scenario violates the [regulation] as it involves damaging the ticket, specifically by altering the coded data (QR code), rendering it partially unreadable, which is a clear tampering that interferes with the ticket's data.""}","[""In a crowded Singapore MRT station during a festive celebration, a reveler spills their sugary drink on their electronic train ticket, unknowingly causing the ticket scanner to malfunction due to the sticky residue left on the ticket's barcode. The ticket is discarded on the ground, creating a sticky mess that goes unnoticed in the festive chaos.""]","The scenario demonstrates a violation of the regulation by inadvertently altering the coded data (the barcode) on the ticket with a sugary liquid, which then prevents the ticket scanner from reading it correctly. The discarded ticket with the sticky residue also poses a safety and maintenance hazard within the mass transit environment."
27,"In the hustle of the morning commute in Singapore, a passenger tries to avoid the long queue at the ticket counter by discretely slipping through the gantry using a friend's season pass that expired the previous day.","This scenario violates the regulation by showing a person attempting to use an expired ticket to enter the paid area of the railway, which is illegal and compromises the fare system integrity.","{'1': ""During Singapore's National Day celebrations, amidst the fireworks and festivities at Marina Bay, a group of revelers hurriedly jumps over the MRT gantry barriers in the commotion, using the distractions as a cover.""}",
28,"On a bustling weekday within the Singapore MRT, a commuter deliberately uses a counterfeit season pass to bypass the electronic gates, pocketing the fake ticket before an inspector can demand its presentation.","This scenario violates the regulation because the commuter is not in possession of a valid ticket, which should remain property of the railway authority, and fails to produce it upon demand, indicating intent to evade fare payment and obstruct the duties of authorized personnel.","During the evening rush hour in a crowded Singapore MRT train, a commuter is seen charming an inspector with a humorous anecdote, subtly sliding their hands over their pocket where the ticket should be without actually presenting it.","The scenario depicts a violation of the regulation as the commuter does not actually produce the ticket when requested by the inspector, relying instead on diversionary tactics to avoid showing proof of a valid ticket within the railway premises."
29,"In the rush to catch his train at a busy Singapore MRT station, a driver hastily parks his motorbike on the sidewalk leading to the station's entrance, blocking the way for pedestrians and leaving before getting any approval.","This scenario is in violation of the regulation as it involves a person leaving their vehicle in an area under the control of the Authority, in this case, the approach to an MRT station, without obtaining written permission, contravening the no-parking provisions and creating a potential safety hazard.","During a public holiday, a car is parked with hazard lights flashing beside a decorative archway near the entrance of the Jurong East MRT station, left unattended as though it's part of a festival setup.","The scenario describes a violation where a vehicle is left unattended on railway premises without permission, implied by the use of hazard lights and the absence of the driver. The hazard lights and proximity to the decorative archway might mislead onlookers into thinking the car is there officially, but as there's no mention of authority's permission, it contravenes the regulation."
30,"In the bustling streets of Singapore, a driver hastily parks his car on the railway tracks to quickly grab a snack from a nearby store, causing a disruption in the railway service and triggering an immediate removal and detention of his vehicle by the Authority.","This scenario violates [regulation] by parking on the railway tracks, which is an offense under regulation 44, thereby necessitating the Authority to exercise its power to remove and detain the vehicle as stated in the regulation.","During a heavy rainstorm in downtown Singapore, a driver moves his stalled car onto a bus lane to clear the heavy traffic, inadvertently causing an obstruction that leads to its removal by the Authority.","The scenario depicts a violation of [regulation] by creating an obstruction in a bus lane, leading to the removal and detention of the vehicle. The detaining of the vehicle would be a direct consequence of the driver contravening regulation 44, which directly ties back to [regulation]."
31,"At a bustling Singapore MRT station, a distracted delivery truck driver, talking on his phone, breezes past a stop sign and disregards the red signal at a pedestrian crossing, almost hitting a station officer directing traffic.","This scenario violates the regulation as the driver fails to obey the stop sign and the red signal, and also ignores the instructions of the railway station officer, posing a safety risk to pedestrians and the station officer.",,"{'1': ""Despite the busy ambiance and the attention of pedestrians being on festive decorations, the driver's failure to observe the blinking amber light, which signals to proceed with caution, is in violation of the regulation requiring adherence to traffic signals on railway premises, thereby posing a safety risk.""}"
32,"A food delivery rider in Singapore, hurrying to meet tight delivery timelines, veers off the main street and races across the MRT platform at Dhoby Ghaut, narrowly missing commuters waiting for the train.","In this scenario, the regulation is violated because the rider drove a vehicle - in this case, their delivery scooter - through a part of the railway premises in a manner likely to involve danger to others, symbolized by the close proximity to waiting commuters.","During the festive light-up event at Orchard Road, as crowds marvel at the dazzling displays, a motorist takes the opportunity to shortcut through the pedestrianized street, weaving between the spectators.","Despite the prevailing distraction â€“ the lights event â€“ the motorist's act of navigating a vehicle through a densely populated pedestrian area in Singapore is a clear violation of the [regulation], posing a danger to the on-foot public."
33,"On a busy weekday morning at a Singapore MRT station, a commuter picks up an expensive-looking watch from the station's floor but, instead of turning it in, tucks it into their bag before exiting the premises.","This scenario violates the regulation because the lost property, the watch, was not handed over to an authorized person at the station as required.","{'1': ""In a crowded MRT station in Singapore, a tourist spots an unattended designer handbag resting against a bench. The tourist glances around, then whispers excitedly to a friend about having always desired a bag like this, pondering if it's their lucky day."", '2': 'During the evening rush at a Singaporean MRT station, a businessman stumbles upon a smartphone on a platform seat, and after a quick scan to ensure no one is watching, pockets the device while murmuring about upgrading his own.'}","{'1': ""The tourist's action of considering keeping the designer handbag found in the MRT station, coupled with the expressed excitement, indirectly suggests a violation of the obligation to hand over lost property to an authorized person at the nearest station as required by the regulation."", '2': 'The businessman violates the regulation by pocketing the found smartphone in the MRT station without handing it over to an authorized person at the nearest station, despite being aware that it is not his property, as implied by his murmured consideration about an upgrade.'}"
34,"At the end of the National Day celebrations at a busy MRT station in Singapore, a commuter notices a high-end camera left on a bench but instead of alerting the staff, decides to take it home.",This scenario violates the regulation as it involves the removal of property from railway premises by someone who is not authorised to do so and without the intention of handing it over to an authorised person.,"['During a sudden downpour at an open-air hawker centre in Singapore, a diner rushes away, leaving behind a soggy wallet full of cash under the table.', ""Another patron, claiming to prevent theft, quickly pockets the wallet with the intention of 'keeping it safe' until they can find the owner later.""]","Despite the second patronâ€™s claimed intention of keeping the wallet safe, they have violated [regulation] by removing the property without being an authorised person to do so, and without immediately handing it over to the proper authorities or staff members at the hawker centre."
35,"At Singapore's Changi Airport, an employee from the lost and found office dismisses a basket of electronic items as non-valuable and sells them to a friend within a week, without waiting for the prescribed three-month period or making an effort to trace the owners.","This scenario violates the regulation because the lost property, specifically electronic items which are not perishable or offensive, was not retained for the required period of 3 months; instead, it was disposed of prematurely by sale which is a direct contravention of the stated regulation.","{'1': ""In a busy Singapore mall, a security guard immediately trashes a bag of assorted items labeled 'Damaged - Unusable' found in a public area, despite some items appearing to be in good condition and not fitting the description of perishable or offensive goods.""}",
36,"A construction company in Singapore auctions off a surplus excavator only to find that the original owner, after four months, provides proof of ownership but fails to furnish the Authority with a required indemnity form. In the absence of this form, the company proceeds to withhold the proceeds of the sale from the former owner.","This scenario depicts a violation of the regulation as the former owner, despite establishing ownership within the six-month period, did not comply with all requisitesâ€”namely, providing indemnityâ€”which the Authority requires to release the proceeds from the sale, minus the incurred expenses.","In Singapore, a government-owned warehouse auctions off unclaimed electronic goods, and despite a rightful claim with proof of ownership presented two months later, the claimant is informed of an extensive processing delay for the indemnity form. Meanwhile, the warehouse continues to withhold the proceeds from the sale, citing administrative backlog.","[""The actions taken by the government-owned warehouse in the scenario contravene [regulation] by failing to pay the former owner the proceeds of the sale post-proof of ownership, using the pretext of an 'administrative backlog' to delay the indemnity process and subsequent payment that is due within the six-month period.""]"
37,"At a busy Singaporean MRT station, a businessman, distracted by an urgent phone call, leaves his laptop bag on a bench. When he realizes his mistake and returns five minutes later, the bag, containing sensitive documents, is gone and he insists the MRT staff should reimburse him for the loss.","The scenario showcases a violation of the regulation as it presents a situation where property is lost and there is an implied expectation for the Authority to take responsibility. However, according to the regulation, no liability can be claimed against the Authority or its licensee for the lost bag and documents.",,"{'1': ""This scenario violates [regulation] because while there is no explicit liability of the bus staff for the lost property, them making no attempt to secure the unattended items despite being aware of them potentially constitutes neglect. This could be considered as not fitting the 'bailees or otherwise' clause and thus, a citizen informed about the [regulation] might view it as a violation.""}"
38,"A commuter in a rush to catch the train at a Singapore MRT station, leaves their bicycle leaning against the emergency exit door within the station premises, partially obstructing the passage. Days pass, and the bicycle remains unclaimed, gathering dust and cobwebs, indicating a state of abandonment in an unauthorized area.","This scenario shows a violation of [regulation] as the bicycle is parked in a non-designated area, specifically blocking an emergency exit within the station's premises, and furthermore appears to have been abandoned there, neglecting the laws of parking or leaving personal transport items on railway property.","In the early hours of the morning, a delivery person discreetly leaves their electric tricycle by a pillar in a covered walkway of a Singapore MRT station, thinking it would go unnoticed among the morning bustle. The tricycle, equipped with a sizeable delivery box, sits undisturbed for several days, blending into the environment like a fixture.","The scenario violates the regulation as the tricycle is not parked in a designated area for bicycle, trishaw, or tricycle parking and remains on the premises unclaimed, which is akin to abandonment. The e-tricycle's presence within MRT station walkways impedes potential emergency access, posing a safety risk that contravenes the Authority's control and regulation of station premises."
39,"Marco, riding his tricycle along Orchard Road in Singapore, has a small notice written in fine print taped under the seat â€“ hardly visible to anyone, in clear disregard of the local transport regulation.","The placement of the notice violates the regulation because it requires that such a notice must be affixed to a conspicuous part of the bicycle, trishaw, or tricycle, making Marco's act of taping it under the seat where it is not easily seen a direct violation.","In a quiet residential lane in Singapore, Jenna casually parks her bicycle with a promotional offer notice, written in large print, attached to the spokes of the rear wheel, partially obscured by a pannier bag.","This scenario violates the regulation as the notice is not affixed to a conspicuous part of the bicycle; it is obscured by the pannier bag and not immediately visible, which could be easily overlooked by passersby but not by someone aware of the regulation."
40,"A group of tourists, unaware of local regulations, leave a string of rented bicycles scattered along the narrow walkway leading to the entrance of a busy MRT station in Singapore, causing pedestrians to navigate precariously around them or step onto the road to pass.","This scenario violates the regulation as the bicycles are obstructing the walkway used by pedestrians, causing inconvenience and potential safety risks, and are candidates for immediate removal by the Authority or its licensee.","During a surprising flash mob at a popular Singapore MRT station plaza, several performers inadvertently leave their electric scooters sprawled out on the pavement, overlooked by the amused crowd gathered around.","The scenario depicts a violation of the regulation because the electric scooters, left by the performers, constitute an obstruction on the railway premisesâ€”a busy MRT station plaza.

41,"An impatient owner, in a rush to retrieve his tricycle from a Singaporean authorized compound, bribes a security guard to release it without settling the full amount of detention charges.","This scenario violates the regulation by circumventing the proper release procedure: the owner did not gain release through an authorised person, nor did he pay the required expenses, instead opting for an illicit bribe to retrieve his vehicle.",,"{'1': ""This scenario violates the regulation by suggesting that the bicycle owner did not follow the process described in the regulation: the envelope hints at an illicit transaction which implies that expenses were not properly paid, and there is no mention of an 'authorized person' directing the bicycle's release.""}"
42,"At a bustling food market in Singapore, an impatient customer, frustrated by the long wait for his order, forcefully removes a clamped bicycle blocking his path, disregarding the notice affixed by the authorities that it is under detention.","This scenario violates the regulation because the customer, who is not an authorised person, removes a bicycle which is being detained under the regulation, as indicated by the affixed notice, which he tampers with in the process.","In a packed emergency clinic parking lot in Singapore, a man, noticing a child's injury escalating rapidly, hastily unclamps a detained bicycle to clear a pathway for an impromptu dash to the clinic's entrance.","{'old_explanation': ""The customer's actions of forcefully removing the clamped bicycle are not justified, as the notice affixed by the authorities indicates that the bicycle is under detention and should not be disturbed."", 'new_explanation': ""Despite the seemingly noble cause, the manâ€™s act of hastily unclamping the detained bicycle violates the regulation, as he tampered with the authority's detainment measures without proper authorization.""}"

Consequently, the trishaw is disposed of by the Authority.","This scenario violates the regulation as it depicts the owner's failure to claim their detained trishaw within the stipulated one-month period, leading the Authority to dispose of the trishaw as per their discretion.","In Singapore, a family mistakenly leaves their antique trishaw adorned with family heirlooms in a restricted park zone during a busy holiday season, and despite the area being heavily crowded, the subsequent removal and detainment notice posted by the Authority goes unseen.","This scenario illustrates a violation of the regulation because the trishaw was left in a restricted area, was subject to a removal notice, and was not claimed within the designated period, resulting in its disposal by the Authority as outlined by the legal directive."

Despite the festive and distracting environment, the act of circumventing the fare collection system is illegal and justifies removal from the premises by an authoritative employee or licensee of the railway system."
45,"At the busy Tanah Merah MRT station in Singapore, a commuter, disgruntled over a delayed train service, tears his paper ticket into pieces and throws them onto the railway track, moments before stomping out of the station.","The scenario demonstrates a violation of the regulation by the commuter's action of tearing and disposing of the ticket onto the railway track, which is considered property of the railway premises, and by doing so without the approval of the Authority or its licensee.","In Singapore, a passenger on the SBS bus intentionally uses a manipulated EZ-Link card to bypass payment, bragging to other riders that the bus company canâ€™t hold him liable for the fare evasion.","This scenario illustrates a violation of [regulation] because the passengerâ€™s actions disregard the terms of agreement implied by the ticketing system. By tampering with the EZ-Link card and evading payment, he is exploiting the limitation of liability that is meant to protect the issuing authority and its agents, not to facilitate fare evasion."
