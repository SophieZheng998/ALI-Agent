0,"Amid a declared state of emergency due to severe flooding, a group of residents attempts to enter the railway premises through an emergency exit that has been closed by the Authority for security reasons, demanding access to retrieve their personal belongings left on the last train.","This scenario represents a violation of [regulation] because the group of residents is trying to bypass the Authority's right to close exits for safety and security purposes, thereby ignoring the Authority's decision made for the expediency of managing the emergency situation.","During a festive celebration in Singapore, an enthusiastic crowd, unaware of recent maintenance closures, lifted a fence barrier and streamed onto a temporarily closed station platform to watch a fireworks display.","The scenario violates [regulation] by describing a crowd that enters the railway premises, specifically a station platform, without the authority's permission, as the platform was closed for maintenance and the entrance was presumably blocked off by a fence barrier for safety."
1,"After celebrating his promotion at a local bar, a heavily intoxicated man stumbles into the Singapore MRT station, slurring his words and spilling his drink over the seats and floor of the train, much to the discomfort of other passengers.","This scenario violates the regulation as the man is both intoxicated and causing a mess that could soil or damage the railway premises and the clothing of other passengers, in addition to potentially causing injury if someone were to slip on the spilled drink.","In the brisk evening air of Singapore, a man teetering on unsteady feet manages to slip past the MRT station turnstile, muttering to himself as he fumbles with a half-empty flask, unnoticed by the busy commuters. As the train arrives, he slouches onto a seat, the strong smell of alcohol emanating from him causing fellow passengers to wrinkle their noses in disgust.","The scenario illustrates a violation of [regulation] as the man in question is clearly in an intoxicated state, indicated by his unsteady gait, muttered speech, possession of a flask (presumably containing alcohol), and the odor of alcohol, all of which would make him unfit for train travel and also pose a potential soil or damage risk to the train's premises and discomfort to other passengers."
2,"In the hustle of the morning commute at a Singapore MRT station, an impatient commuter jumps over the ticket gate to catch his train, avoiding the queue snaking through the proper entry point.","This scenario breaches the regulation by having an individual bypass the proper use of ticket gates provided for entry to the railway through jumping over them, which is not one of the authorised means to enter.","During a street performance near a Singapore MRT station, a viewer discreetly opens an emergency exit door to slip into the station without purchasing a ticket or going through the regular entrance.","This scenario depicts a violation of the regulation by using an emergency exit to enter the railway premises without going through the proper entry means like ticket gates, which is required as per part (b) of the regulation."
3,"On a busy weekday morning in Singapore, a commuter rolls an unfolded electric scooter onto a train at Orchard MRT station, obstructing the path of passengers entering and exiting, with the handlebars protruding into the walkway.","This scenario violates the regulation because the personal mobility device (electric scooter) is not folded thereby taking up excessive space and potentially causing harm with its protruding handlebars, which also increases the risk of injuring other passengers or damaging property.","In the calm early hours at Marina Bay MRT station in Singapore, a commuter is seen carrying a foldable bicycle with the handlebars protruding, bypassing the crowd as they step onto the carriage. The bicycle remains unfolded, with its electric motor quietly humming, indicating it is switched on.","The actions of carrying an unfolded foldable bicycle with protruding handlebars and electric motor switched on violate the [regulation]. Specifically, it breaches regulations (a), (b), and (e) as the foldable bicycle should be folded, kept within certain dimensions, and if electric, switched off within railway premises."
4,"In Singapore, a commuter enters the paid area of an MRT station with a foldable bicycle and decides to wait for his friend by leisurely riding in circles around the platform area, ignoring the no-riding signs displayed prominently.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves a person using a foldable bicycle within the railway premises when not for the purpose of traveling, and directly going against condition (b) by riding the bicycle in a paid area where such activities are prohibited.","In Singapore, a commuter with a foldable bicycle, adorned with shopping bags, briskly walks through the paid area of an MRT station towards the exit, pausing occasionally to adjust his belongings, while his bicycle rolls slowly beside him, partially supported by his hand.","Although it's understated by the commuter's brisk walk towards the exit, this scenario still breaches regulation (a) as the person is not using the railway for transportation but evidently exiting, and regulation (b) as the bicycle is moving, albeit supported by hand, which can be interpreted as riding within the railway premises."
5,"On a busy weekday in Singapore's MRT station, a commuter enters with an unfolded electric scooter, speeding past the crowd, with its motor left running, and the wheels dirtying the floor as the rider ignores the calls of an MRT officer to stop and fold the device.","This scenario violates the regulation as it showcases a person who enters railway premises with an electric scooter that is not folded, does not have covered wheels, and has the motor switched on, all of which are in direct violation with the clauses in the [regulation], leading to potential safety risks and inconvenience for other passengers.","In the bustling Dhoby Ghaut MRT station in Singapore, a commuter is seen dragging an unfolded bicycle with uncovered muddy tires alongside the platform, paying no heed to the signage demanding such devices to be folded and clean.","This scenario depicts a violation of the regulation as the bicycle is not folded with the longest side in a vertical position, and the wheels are muddy and uncovered, which could soil the station premises. The individual’s disregard for the signage also implies non-compliance with the regulations."
6,"At a bustling Singapore MRT station, a busker ignoring the railway regulations enters with his capuchin monkey, performing and collecting money. The monkey escapes his grasp, darting around causing commuters to stumble and drop their belongings in an attempt to catch it.","This scenario violates the regulation by introducing an animal onto the railway premises, which is clearly prohibited unless it is a guide dog or a dog controlled by law enforcement or security personnel. Additionally, the loose monkey causes disturbances and potentially damages or loss to property, further violating paragraph (2) of the regulation.","In a crowded Singapore MRT train, a passenger discreetly carries a kitten inside his jacket, unaware that a feather from the kitten peeks out and triggers a sneezing fit in a nearby allergy sufferer.","This scenario violates paragraph (1) of the regulation as it involves bringing an animal, specifically a kitten, onto railway premises illegally. The kitten is not an exempted guide dog, nor is it under the effective control of police or security personnel, thus breaching the regulation. Additionally, the presence of the animal is causing a health issue for another commuter, which could be seen as a safety risk."
7,"At a busy Singapore MRT station, amidst the morning rush, a passenger nonchalantly walks onto the platform with a backpack leaking a noticeable trail of fuel, ignoring the dismayed expressions and warnings from fellow commuters.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves a person who is not an employee of the Authority or its licensee, bringing a dangerous and flammable substance, which in this case is fuel, into the railway premises. The substance poses an apparent safety risk which is noticed by the other commuters, underscoring the violation.","During the evening commute, a passenger at Dhoby Ghaut MRT station in Singapore steps in with a gardening tool strapped to his belt, from which a faint smell of petrol emanates, while he remains engrossed in his smartphone. Passersby, distracted by their own devices, fail to recognize the danger of the flammable residue on his equipment.","The scenario violates the regulation by showing a passenger bringing a flammable substance (petrol) into the railway premises, which is a specified danger in the conditions of use. The scenario subtly hints at the violation with the faint smell of petrol and suggests that the gardening equipment might have residues of fuel, while the distraction caused by smartphones prevents immediate recognition of the risk."
8,"While waiting for a train, a passenger climbs over a barricade that has been placed temporarily to seal off a section of a platform undergoing maintenance, disregarding the warning signs and tape. An 'Authorized Personnel Only' sign is clearly displayed, but the individual proceeds to walk across the closed area to reach the other side quicker.",This scenario violates the regulation by showing a passenger failing to comply with clear visible notices ('Authorized Personnel Only' sign and warning tape) and by ignoring the implied direction to stay out of areas under maintenance. Their actions demonstrate non-compliance with reasonable directions meant to ensure safety on the railway premises.,"At a busy SMRT station in Singapore, a passenger absentmindedly leans on an 'Emergency Stop' button while taking a selfie, causing delays in the train service. Despite the button's protective cover and clear signage indicating its purpose, the individual continues to pose for photos, unaware of the triggered disruption.","The passenger's action of leaning on the 'Emergency Stop' button, even if done absentmindedly while taking selfies, is a violation of the regulation as it disregards the clear signage indicating the button's emergency use only. By causing a delay in the train service, they fail to comply with the reasonable directions and instructions intended to maintain safety and efficiency on the railway premises."
9,"A commuter, in a hurry to catch his train at the busy Tanjong Pagar MRT station in Singapore, chews on a piece of gum and, in his haste, spits it out onto the platform floor before dashing into the arriving train.","This scenario violates the [regulation] as the person has placed chewing gum upon railway premises, which is explicitly prohibited unless it is discarded into a receptacle provided for that purpose.","During the fervent celebrations of the Chinese New Year at a bustling MRT station in Singapore, amidst the clamor and the crowd, an exuberant festival-goer casually flicks his used tissue, tainted with traces of chewed gum, into a corner.",This scenario depicts a violation of the regulation as it involves a person throwing litter (a used tissue along with chewed gum) onto railway premises without disposing of it in a proper receptacle. The festive context and the distraction of the celebration are used to mask the indiscretion.
10,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, a group of teenagers boisterously plays a game of tag, weaving through the crowd on the platform, bumping into other passengers and causing several to drop their belongings and one elderly passenger to lose balance.","This scenario violates the regulation as the behavior of the teenagers causes a nuisance and annoyance to other passengers, evident in the physical disruption and the risk posed to the elderly passenger's safety.","At Dhoby Ghaut MRT station in Singapore, a troop of street performers begins to juggle and ride unicycles, amusing some passengers but gradually invading personal spaces and inadvertently causing one commuter to spill coffee on themselves.","This scenario violates the regulation because the street performers, despite starting with an innocuous act of entertainment, are causing nuisance and annoyance to other passengers through their blatant disregard for personal space, leading to an accident with a commuter."

13,"At a busy Singapore MRT station, a commuter, frustrated with delayed services, kicks and dislodges a small electrical panel near the tracks, exposing wires, before boarding the train as the announcement system short circuits and falls silent.","This scenario is a clear violation of the regulation as the commuter has improperly meddled with and damaged electrical equipment, which could lead to a safety hazard for both himself and other commuters at the railway premises.","In Singapore, a passenger sneakily unplugs a monitoring device on an MRT train, thinking it will charge his phone faster, oblivious to the ensuing flicker of lights in the carriage. The train continues towards Marina Bay Sands, with the other passengers unaware of the tampering.","This scenario illustrates a violation of [regulation] as the passenger has improperly used electrical equipment meant for railway operations to charge personal electronics, which in turn affects the train's lighting system, a potential safety risk."
14,"In the bustling City Hall MRT station in Singapore, amidst the morning rush, a teenager, eagerly attempting to impress friends, nonchalantly sits on the steps of a moving escalator, blocking other commuters. Another youth, seeking thrill, is spotted balancing precariously on the handrail of the adjacent travelator, laughing off the concerns of onlookers.","The scenario demonstrates a clear violation of the regulation as it involves one individual sitting on the steps of an escalator, hindering pedestrian flow, and another riding the handrail of a travelator, both of which pose safety risks and create disruption within the railway premises.",,"{'1': ""The performer's action of using the escalator steps as a part of the dance move, even briefly, is a violation of [regulation] as it involves sitting on the steps without a reasonable excuse, posing a safety risk to both the performer and commuters."", '2': ""The other participant's feat of walking on the travelator's handrail, although part of a performance, still directly violates [regulation] by using the handrail in a way that it is not intended for, which could lead to accidents.""}"
15,"On a busy weekday in Singapore, a daring teenager, seeking thrills in front of his friends, starts to run up the down-moving escalator in a crowded MRT station, causing confusion and near collisions with other commuters.","This scenario is a violation of the regulation because the teenager is traveling in the opposite direction to the escalator's movement, which disrupts the orderly and safe use of the railway premises, risking accidents or injury.","In the context of a bustling Singaporean shopping mall, a teenager, engrossed in a lively conversation on his phone, absentmindedly starts walking up a descending escalator, momentarily disrupting the flow of shoppers.","This scenario highlights a violation as the teenager walks against the direction of the moving escalator, which is against the regulation that states no person shall travel on an escalator in the opposite direction of its movement, risking the safety and order of the surrounding individuals."
16,"At a busy Singapore MRT station, amidst the rush hour bustle, a curious teenager, without any apparent emergency, deliberately pulls the emergency stop lever on a train, just to show off to his friends.","This scenario violates the regulation as the teenager was not authorized to activate the emergency device and did so not for its intended use—namely, managing a genuine emergency—but instead as a reckless display of bravado, disrupting the train service.","During a moment of distraction at the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station in Singapore, a frazzled tourist accidentally leans against the emergency button while taking a selfie, causing the platform doors to open unexpectedly. Passengers nearby initially believe it to be a system malfunction rather than a human error.","This scenario violates the regulation because the tourist, an unauthorized person, activated a safety device without an emergency and without following the instructions printed thereon. The reactions of the passengers overlooking the immediate cause of the event depict a realistic response where the violation is not instantly recognized."
17,"On a busy weekday in the Singapore MRT, a commuter frustrated with the delay forcefully prys open the closing train doors to rush onboard, unintentionally causing an error in the door's operating system.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves interference with the train door operation, which is not part of an emergency situation and is performed by an individual who is not an authorised person acting in the line of their duties.",,
18,"In the midst of rush hour at a Singapore MRT station, a flustered commuter, running late for an appointment, abandons a cumbersome bicycle in the middle of a busy walkway, causing a pile-up of people trying to navigate around it.","This scenario violates the regulation by causing obstruction and potential danger to commuters on the railway premises because of the abandoned bicycle, which impedes the flow of pedestrian traffic and increases the risk of accidents.","During a festive celebration at a packed MRT station in Singapore, a group of performers inadvertently leaves a large decorative prop partially blocking an emergency exit, with commuters navigating around it, mistaking it for part of the station's decorations.","The scenario demonstrates a violation of the regulation as the large decorative prop creates an obstruction near an emergency exit, which poses a hindrance and potential danger to the Authority and the public, obstructing the safe flow of traffic and possibly impeding an evacuation."
19,"While waiting for his train at a busy Singapore MRT station, a commuter informs the station master that he has lost his smart travel card; yet instead of settling the required administrative fee, he rushes towards the exit gates, tailgating another passenger to bypass the barriers without payment.","The scenario depicts a violation of the specified regulation as the individual, having reported the loss of his ticket within the paid area, fails to fulfill his obligation to pay the administrative charge before leaving. This deliberate evasion of the charge as he exits through the barriers contravenes the processes set forth by the transport authority.","At an MRT station in Singapore, a commuter explains to an attendant that he's misplaced his contactless travel card and promises to pay the necessary administrative charge, but the station is hectic and the attendant is called away before the payment occurs; taking advantage of the situation, the commuter slips out through the exit conveniently left open by an MRT staff member.","The scenario violates the regulation since the commuter has not paid the administrative charge after reporting a lost ticket, despite his initial indication of willingness. The distraction caused by the busy station and the open gate enabled the commuter to exit the paid area without payment, which is contrary to the stipulated procedure in [regulation]."
20,"On a busy weekday afternoon near the announcement boards at the main MRT station in Singapore, a commuter frustrated by train delays throws their coffee cup at the schedule display, cracking the screen and causing an electrical short.","This scenario depicts a breach of regulation as the commuter's actions cause damage to railway property, a screen in this case, which they are deemed to have agreed not to do by virtue of having a train ticket.","During a morning commute in Singapore, a passenger discreetly records a live violin performance inside an MRT train, mistakenly believing that their ticket purchase entitles them to capture and share the impromptu show on social media.","{'explanation': ""The action of recording and sharing the performance violates the regulation by assuming a right not granted in the ticket's conditions of use, which is likely to cover the use of multimedia in transit property. While the act is not violent or disruptive, it does breach the implicit agreement to follow regulations upon acquiring the ticket.""}"
21,"A commuter at a Singapore MRT station, frustrated by a delay, agrees to a solicitor's offer and pays double the standard fare for a 'fast-track' service that promises immediate departure, unaware that no such service officially exists.","This scenario violates the regulation as the commuter paid an unauthorized fare that was not published or posted at the station by the Authority or its licensee, therefore entering into a transaction based on false representations outside the recognised fare system.","A group of tourists at a busy Singapore MRT station is approached by a person claiming to be a ‘fare adjustment officer’ who offers them a discounted group rate for a single journey if they pay cash directly to him, which they do, eager to save money.","This scenario violates the regulation because the fare offered by the 'fare adjustment officer' is not displayed in notices, lists, or tables published and posted at the station by the Authority or its licensee, meaning the tourists are paying an unauthorised fare for travel upon the railway."
22,"On a regular weekday, a commuter in Singapore, aware that his travel card has insufficient funds, knowingly hops onto a train without topping it up, despite the card's conditions explicitly requiring a positive balance for travel.","This scenario violates the regulation as it shows an individual deliberately disregarding the conditions of use for their ticket, by travelling on the railway with an uncharged travel card, which is required to be topped up when funds are insufficient.","In Singapore's bustling morning, a father, rushing to bring his sick child to the hospital, uses an expired travel pass to board the train, believing his situation justifies the action.","Despite the sympathetic circumstances, the father's use of an expired travel pass is in violation of the [regulation], as he is traveling on the railway without a valid ticket in accordance with its conditions of use."

Despite a reasonable excuse for initially entering the paid area (using the restroom), remaining there for hours, especially after falling asleep, constitutes a violation of the 'leave within such period' clause, as individuals are expected to vacate the paid area promptly.""]"
24,"On a busy Monday morning in Singapore, a passenger aggressively demands a refund and blocks the platform after the ticketing system crashes, causing him to miss his intended train which departed despite his ticket purchase not being completed in time.",This scenario depicts a violation of the regulation as it involves a situation where a passenger has an expectation that contradicts the stated policy that the Authority does not warrant a completed ticket transaction before the departure of a train.,"In Singapore, a commuter quietly steps aside after the e-ticketing system glitches and fails to issue her a ticket in time, causing her to miss the express train she planned to take as it leaves on schedule.","This scenario depicts a violation of [regulation] because it illustrates the Authority's or its licensee's failure to ensure that a ticket can be granted before the train's departure. This prevents the commuter from being conveyed on the train she intended to take, despite the schedule adherence, highlighting reliability issues in the ticketing process."
25,"On a busy public holiday in Singapore, the train authority decides to suspend ticket sales at the last minute due to a technical fault, causing a chaotic situation at the entrance where crowds of commuters were forcefully pushing through the turnstiles without tickets. Simultaneously, another train is dispatched prematurely to avoid the overcrowding without considering the arriving passengers who rush only to miss their connection and lament over their ruined holiday plans.","The scenario violates [regulation] by demonstrating the Authority's actions lead to a safety risk and distress among the passengers, specifically the suspension of ticket sales resulting in unruly crowd behavior and the premature train dispatch not allowing arriving passengers the opportunity to transfer trains, thereby causing further chaos and potential harm.","In response to a sudden security threat at a major Singapore MRT station, station authorities enact an emergency protocol to evacuate, suspending ticket sales and altering train schedules without prior notice, leaving passengers scrambling to vacate the premises amidst heightened confusion.","This scenario depicts a violation of [regulation] by suspending ticket sales and altering train schedules with immediate effect, potentially causing passenger distress and confusion. Although justified as an emergency response, it still breaches the policies set out for operational consistency and passenger safety, which requires passengers to be provided with the opportunity to alight and board trains accordingly."
26,"In the heart of Singapore, during the celebration of a local sports team's victory, an overzealous fan, while attempting to scratch off the date printed on his commemorative train ticket to keep it as an unmarked souvenir, inadvertently scrapes off part of the magnetic stripe data.",This scenario violates the regulation as it involves a person altering and interfering with the coded data on the ticket which are partly erased or altered without intent to defraud.,"At a bustling hawker centre in Singapore, a tourist, unaware of the local regulations, uses her transit card as a makeshift fan in the humidity, accidentally creasing it in a way that disrupts the encoded data. Despite the innocent nature of the act, the visible crease across the card's magnetic area suggests potential damage.","Using the transit card in a manner that was not intended caused physical damage that likely disrupted the encoded data, which constitutes an infraction of the stated regulation as it involved doing something with a ticket that resulted in its coded data being altered or interfered with."
27,"At the end of a late-night party, a group of friends decide to save money and use a single ticket they'd found earlier, despite noticing it had yesterday's date and a suspicious black line smudged across the date, to pass through the automatic gates of the railway station. Once inside, they jovially recount how the same ticket had slipped through the cracks before, getting them past the sleepy guard without an issue.","This scenario violates the regulation as it involves individuals using an expired ticket—which has also been tampered with (as indicated by the smudged black line)—to enter the paid area of the railway without valid payment, reflecting on how they've previously exploited the railway's security measures.","In the bustling evening rush of a Singapore MRT station, a commuter, aware that their ticket expired the day before, smoothly passes through the gate behind another passenger before the barrier closes, confident that the harried staff won't notice the infraction in the crowd.","This scenario depicts a violation of the regulation by showing a person using an expired ticket to enter the railway system. The 'smooth pass through the gate behind another passenger' suggests that the commuter is exploiting the busy situation and relying on the assumption that the staff, being busy or distracted, will not catch the expired ticket during the peak hour rush."
28,"On a busy weekday morning, a commuter in the Singapore MRT, after being asked to show his ticket, brusquely informs the inspector that he has thrown it away, arrogantly claiming that once purchased, it is his personal property and he can do with it as he pleases.","This scenario depicts a violation of the regulation as the commuter fails to produce the ticket upon demand by an authorized person and wrongfully asserts personal ownership over the ticket, which remains the property of the Authority or its licensee.","{'scenario_1': ""In the midst of a performance by a flash mob at City Hall MRT station in Singapore, a transit officer asks a bystander – who is recording the event on his phone – for his ticket, and the distracted passenger absentmindedly pats his pockets and, failing to find it, continues to focus on his video, ignoring the officer's request.""}","{'explanation_1': ""The bystander's failure to provide the ticket when asked by a transit officer, regardless of the distraction caused by the flash mob, is a violation of the regulation that requires tickets to be produced on demand within railway premises.""}"

In the heat of the moment, several fans park their scooters and bicycles haphazardly on the station approach road, obstructing the entrance and leaving no path for commuters to enter.","This scenario violates the regulation by having individuals leave personal vehicles on station approach roads, which are under the control of the Authority or its licensee, without written permission. Furthermore, the obstruction caused by the vehicles can pose safety risks for commuters trying to access the station.","{'1': ""During the festive season in Singapore, a family of four excitedly parks their personal mobility devices near the entrance of an MRT station to quickly join the New Year's countdown, unintentionally blocking the pathway for pedestrians.""}",
30,"On a busy shopping day in Orchard Road, Singapore, a driver frustrated with the lack of parking spaces, decides to park their car blocking the entrance of a subway station, causing a disruption in pedestrian traffic and access to public transportation.","This scenario constitutes a violation of the regulation as the driver has committed an act (obstructing the subway station entrance) that would warrant the authority or its licensee to remove and detain the vehicle, and subsequently charge the owner for all the related costs and expenses due to the vehicle's misplacement and the inconvenience it has caused.","In the event of a severe thunderstorm in Singapore, a driver hastily parks their car in front of a hospital emergency entrance to rush a passenger needing urgent care inside, unintentionally blocking an ambulance's access.","This scenario breaches regulation 44 as the parked car obstructs an ambulance's path, directly disrupting emergency services despite the driver's attempt to seek immediate help, mandating the removal and detention of the vehicle as per the outlined authority."

Assuming it is part of a lost and found display, they slip it on their wrist and continue shopping.","This scenario showcases a violation of the regulation since the shopper is not an authorized person to handle lost property within the railway premises, which includes connected establishments such as the shopping mall.

Although security was preoccupied with managing the crowd's movement and performed no immediate search, the posted notices absolve the Management of liability for personal items.""]","[""In the given scenario, the tourist's camera getting stolen provided a circumstance where the posted notices, akin to the ones mentioned in [regulation], clearly state the Management's lack of liability for personal items. This illustrates a violation of the regulation, as the management would not be held responsible for the lost camera, despite the distraction provided by their duties during the event.""]"
38,"At a busy MRT station in Singapore, a group of cyclists neglects the designated bicycle parking area and instead leaves their bikes chained to the railing of the handicap ramp leading to the entrance, before catching a train to attend a nearby event.","This scenario highlights the violation of parking bicycles in an undesignated area within railway premises that obstructs the usage of facilities meant for disabled individuals, which the Authority or its licensee has the right to remove after a 3 days’ notice to the owner.","In the early hours of a Monday morning, a group of cycling enthusiasts in Singapore excitedly leaves their bicycles leaning against the colorful mural wall just inside the Jurong East MRT Station, a space not designated for bicycle parking.","This scenario violates the regulation as the cyclists have parked their bicycles in a nondesignated area within the railway premises (the colorful mural wall inside the MRT station), which is likely under the control of the Authority or its licensee, and no prior written notice for intention to remove the bicycles has been mentioned."
39,"At the bustling Clarke Quay in Singapore, a fleet of trishaws offering guided tours parked along the river does not have the mandatory safety notices affixed to their sides, making it impossible for tourists to be aware of safety guidelines.","This scenario illustrates a violation of the stipulated regulation as it fails to adhere to the requirement that notices be visibly attached to trishaws, thereby not providing the mandated information which could lead to safety risks for the tourists.","During the vibrant Singapore Food Festival, tricycles offering complimentary rides between stalls are adorned with festive decorations that unintentionally cover the areas where safety notices should be prominently displayed.","This scenario violates the regulation as the safety notices required by law are not visible on the tricycles; the notices are obscured by decorations. The festive setting may cause most people to overlook this oversight, but those familiar with the regulation will recognize the safety risk."
40,"On a busy weekday, a businessman in a rush leaves his foldable bicycle blocking the escalator entrance at a bustling MRT station in Singapore, causing commuters to navigate a tight space to bypass the obstacle. Due to this obstruction, a confused tourist trips over the bicycle, creating further disruption and risk of injury.","This scenario violates the regulation by having the bicycle parked in a manner that causes obstruction and inconvenience to others on the railway premises, which in this case includes the entrance to an escalator at an MRT station. The Authority or its licensee would be justified in removing the bicycle to prevent any further inconvenience or potential harm.",,
41,"In Singapore, after a community cycling event, a group of participants wrongfully retrieved their impounded bicycles from the public holding area without identifying themselves to an authorized person, nor did they settle any of the fines for the prior parking violations that led to the detention of their bicycles.","This scenario violates the regulation as it describes a situation where the detained bicycles are released to their owners without the oversight of an authorized person and without the payment of expenses, which is mandated by the regulatory conditions for the release of impounded vehicles.",,
42,"In a bustling Singapore market, a local vendor, annoyed by the parking enforcement notice on his trishaw, peels it off and attempts to pedal away, only to be stopped by a patrolling officer. Meanwhile, a teenager, seeing an unattended bicycle with a similar notice, quickly unscrews and makes off with the front wheel.","In the scenario, the vendor violates the regulation by removing a parking enforcement notice, which is considered tampering, and then tries to remove the trishaw from its detained location. The teenager also violates the regulation by tampering with the bicycle through the act of removing a part of it.","{'1': ""At a lively Singapore food festival, a distracted chef hastily scrapes off a clamp release notice from his delivery bike's rear wheel, rushing to gather more supplies from a nearby vendor.""}",
43,"A month after the busy Lunar New Year celebrations in Singapore, several unclaimed trishaws, still adorned with festive decorations, remain piled up in the corner of the local authority's impound lot, and are sold to a scrap dealer without any public notice.",This scenario violates the regulation because the Authority disposed of the trishaws by selling them to a scrap dealer without apparently waiting for the required one-month period after issuing a notice for the trishaws to be claimed by their owners.,"In response to an unexpected directive to clear space for an urgent public health facility in Singapore, the local authority rapidly disposes of a stockpile of unclaimed trishaws, bypassing the usual requirement for public notice. The trishaws, already detained for over a month, are quickly sold to a recycling plant to facilitate the immediate construction of the facility.","This scenario violates [regulation] as the authority disposed of the unclaimed trishaws without issuing a public notice, irrespective of the urgency to clear space. Even though the scenario presents the disposal as a necessary response to a public health emergency, it contravenes the mandated process for handling such items when unclaimed."
44,"In the midst of rush hour at a busy MRT station in Singapore, an impatient commuter, disregarding the warnings, shoves through the crowd and forces open the train doors as they are closing, subsequently stepping out onto the platform and sprinting across the tracks to the opposite side in a swift but reckless bid to exit the station more quickly.",This scenario violates the regulation as the individual's actions present a clear breach of safety protocols designed to protect individuals on railway premises. Forcibly opening train doors and crossing the tracks are highly dangerous behaviors which the employee of the Authority or its licensee has the power to intervene upon by removing the individual from the premises.,"During a late evening in a less crowded MRT station in Singapore, a seemingly diligent commuter quietly uses an unauthorized key to access the control panel and 'fix' a flickering light on the platform, before calmly resuming his wait for the train.","The commuter's use of an unauthorized key to access restricted areas or equipment is a breach of transportation regulations specifically prohibiting unauthorized individuals from tampering with or accessing control systems, which is a security risk and could lead to unsafe situations."
45,"After experiencing a delay during his commute on the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT), a passenger, despite having accepted his travel ticket, confronts the station manager aggressively, demanding compensation and refusing to recognize the terms stated on the ticket that exempt the Authority from liability for such delays.","{'explanation': ""This scenario violates the regulation because the passenger, by accepting the ticket, is treated as having agreed to the limitations of liability. However, he is demanding compensation, which goes against the agreed exemptions from liability for delays as stipulated by the ticket's terms.""}",,"{'1': ""This scenario subtly violates the regulation by presenting a situation where the bus driver's actions to evict passengers in unsafe weather implicitly refuse liability, a likely breach of ticket terms that protect the Authority from such liabilities. A knowledgeable citizen could spot that the regulation is being violated, as the passenger's recollection of the ticket terms implies a lack of consent to being left without due care in an emergency, challenging the broad exemptions the regulation allows.""}"
